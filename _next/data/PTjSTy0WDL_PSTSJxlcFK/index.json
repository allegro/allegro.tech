There are other ways, and I would like to invite you to explore them with me and learn a little about our\nnervous systems in the process. We’ll find out where the motivation comes from on a biological and psychological level.\nWe’ll also take a look at the changes you can introduce into your day to take advantage of certain mechanisms working\non a neural level and boost your motivation and productivity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-neuroscience-of-motivation\">The neuroscience of motivation</h2>\n\n<p>The key to maintaining energy to work throughout the day is simple – getting and staying motivated.

Dopamine is a hormone (meaning it’s a messenger of the\nbody travelling through the bloodstream) and a neurotransmitter (which indicates its ability to affect communication between\nneurons).</p>\n\n<p>In general, high levels of dopamine cause high drive, motivation and willingness to live, do and experience. Low levels\nof dopamine cause the opposite state — a lack of will to do any effort (doomscrolling or examining the contents of the\nfridge is still in our reach). How much dopamine is currently in our system, how much dopamine there was a moment ago\nand how much we remember enjoying a particular state is for our brains a way to set our level of motivation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-workspace\">The workspace</h3>\n\n<p>In the context of motivation our main area of focus across the nervous system should be the mesocorticolimbic system,\nwhich is responsible for the reward mechanism.</p>\n\n<p>Mesocorticolimbic system consists of dopaminergic and dopaminoceptive neurons — the former is a specialised kind of\nneurons that is capable of producing and emitting dopamine into our body; the latter is capable of detecting and\nreacting to the dopamine.

Evolutionally we are prepared to go out and search for\ndifferent resources, such as food, water or shelter, even though nowadays we might use it to gain slightly different\nthings (like a morning coffee or a salary). The drive to do so is provided by dopamine – which is, as we already know, a\nhormonal fuel of motivation. This mechanism is pretty old and it can be observed widely across the animal kingdom.</p>\n\n<p>When the resources are found we experience a dopamine release — that is an effect of the reward mechanism in our\nmesocorticolimbic pathway. Now, in order to make us go and search for the resources again, the dopamine level must drop,\nso that we feel the lack of those resources as unpleasurable and seek for them again.</p>\n\n<p>The dopamine level drops <strong>lower</strong> than the baseline and the extent of the drop is proportional to the height of the\npeak. Why? The drop of the dopamine level is caused by releasing available dopamine from synaptic vesicles – small\nstructures in the dopaminergic neurons. In time the vesicles get depleted of dopamine – we can only release the hormone\nthat is already there, ready to be deployed. After the release there isn’t enough dopamine in the vesicles to keep the\nbaseline level. It will go back to the baseline eventually, as the neurons produce more of it, but for a period of time\nit’s going to remain low.</p>\n\n<p>Continuous peaks in dopamine level may eventually lead to drop of the baseline level. In that situation a person’s\nbrain, seeking for another reward to elevate it, will try repeating previous dopamine-increasing behaviours. A cascade\nof peaks and drops with repeated behaviours is a mechanism for addiction. This is something that may happen over\nexcessive usage of certain substances but also with social media. Incoming likes, comments and notifications or\nscrollable, neverending feed of videos — all of these generate peaks of dopamine. When we spend time on social media\nexperiencing peak after peak we may start feeling less and less satisfaction but still feel the urge to scroll further —\ndue to the mechanism I have just described. That would explain why social media addiction is such a great challenge\nfor our society.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-and-stay-motivated\">How to get and stay motivated</h2>\n\n<p>After that long lecture on neurobiology, those who are still with me may be asking the question “are we there yet”?

We should be aware of them, both when we need those peaks and when we want to avoid them — and\nsoon you’ll know why.</p>\n\n<p>There is a significant number of substances that may increase the dopamine level above the baseline:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Chocolate might increase it up to 1,5 times, although it only lasts a few seconds.</li>\n  <li>Smoked nicotine or cocaine may cause a 2,5 times increase, amphetamine causes up to 10-fold increase (knowing that\nand how peak and baseline levels of dopamine work, explains the addictive effect those substances have).</li>\n  <li>Alcohol in low doses is also known to cause dopamine release.</li>\n  <li>Ingestion of herbs like saffron, rosemary or oregano may lead to elevation of dopamine levels.</li>\n  <li>Caffeine causes a rather modest increase of dopamine, but also increases sensitivity of some dopamine receptors as\nwell as their number and density.

The former is rather subjective and the height of the peak depends on whether the person\nenjoys the activity itself. For those who do, it may double the dopamine level.</p>\n\n<p>The latter results from involvement of the prefrontal cortex in the mesocorticolimbic system. Do you remember the last\ntime when you’ve been telling somebody about that new thing you’d recently learned? How passionate you’ve felt and how\nhappy and excited you’ve been afterwards? The prefrontal cortex is responsible for assigning rational explanations and\nsubjective experiences to things we engage with. Recalling those interactions might cause a dopamine release and make us\nhappier and more motivated.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"long-term-strategies\">Long-term strategies</h3>\n\n<p>As previously said, the peaks of the dopamine, especially one after the other, will cause the dopamine level to drop\nbelow the baseline. In order to maintain high levels of dopamine (hence high motivation) on a daily basis we should act\nlong-term and affect the baseline level as much as possible. There are ways to do it.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"exposure-to-cold\">Exposure to cold</h4>\n\n<p>Research shows that when a human subject enters cold water (14°C) and stays there for up to an hour it leads to rapid\nincrease in norepinephrine and epinephrine (i.e. adrenaline) and also an increase in dopamine. Dopamine was observed to\ncontinuously rise up to 250% of baseline level and it stayed there for a few hours. It also limited release of cortisol\n— the stress hormone.</p>\n\n<p>An hour-long cold bath is too much for an average person, but the same effect (although on a smaller scale) can be\nacquired by more accessible measures. How about a quick cold shower before work to charge up on that dopamine? Or maybe\njoining a winter swimming community?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-03-21-neuroscience-for-software-engineers-motivation/giphy-downsized-large.gif\" alt=\"A man jumping into snow\" title=\"(from [Giphy](https://media.giphy.com/media/MpJJ7gWng24bjxrMiK/giphy-downsized-large.gif))\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"avoiding-layers-of-dopamine-increasing-factors\">Avoiding layers of dopamine-increasing factors</h4>\n\n<p>Do you start working only with a big hot cup of coffee in your hand? Do you listen to loud music while programming? Or\nmaybe do you treat yourself with a sweet drink after a workout? Are there a lot of such rituals? You might want to\nconsider not having them on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>Every one of these rituals is a dopamine-increasing factor. As you’ve already read, multiple peaks of dopamine one on\ntop of the other might not be a great idea. Layering multiple dopamine-increasing factors on a regular basis might\nseriously affect our ability to release dopamine in general. Spiking the dopamine by multiple activities in a short\nperiod of time leads to lowering the baseline by depleting stored, ready-to-deploy dopamine. That may lead to lowering\nthe baseline dopamine level, what will result in lack of motivation and feeling low in general.</p>\n\n<p>So what should we do? Are those things bad for us? Well, not really. Sometimes these spikes of dopamine from listening\nto music or sweet treats are exactly what we need to get through the day. The key is to differentiate all these “extras”\nwhile we work. Listen to music while working — just not every time. Have that sweet drink — just not every day. Meet\nwith friends for a workout session — but also have these individual sessions once in a while.</p>\n\n<p>Some of us spend our time on meetings while trying to do our individual work at the same time. Some listen to podcasts\nwhile coding. We should keep in mind, though, that multitasking is another way of layering dopamine and doing that on a\ndaily basis will have a negative effect on general motivation.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-03-21-neuroscience-for-software-engineers-motivation/giphy.webp\" alt=\"A man multitasking at work \" title=\"(from [Giphy](\nhttps://media3.giphy.com/media/PvvSfSDFoAL5e/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47mym26elkkk7obya4xr8zj83hva1jlu12l7cvmglq&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g)\n)\" /></p>\n\n<p>Another factor we should keep in mind are distractions. Every email, every slack message, every push notification on\nyour phone will cause a small peak of dopamine. That makes it yet another thing to eliminate if you want to avoid\ndopamine layering.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"focusing-on-intrinsic-motivation\">Focusing on intrinsic motivation</h4>\n\n<p>When we look at the sources of motivation we can divide them in two groups — external sources, such as meeting\nexpectations of other people, fame or financial compensation and intrinsic sources, like enjoyment during an activity or\nfulfilling a personal mission.</p>\n\n<p>What do you like to do after work? Is it playing video games, playing music, baking, practising yoga or maybe watching\nlectures on mathematics on YouTube? (don’t judge me…) Whatever this would be, I bet no one needs to encourage you to do\nthis — you have an intrinsic drive to go and do your thing. You could spend hours on it, and then you’ll feel happy and\nfulfilled. This is how intrinsic motivation works — no external reward is required for you to feel motivated. Wouldn’t\nit be great if you had that in your job?</p>\n\n<p>Research shows that intrinsic motivation brings better results than extrinsic motivation. One could ask a question —\nwhat if we brought those two things together? Well, the results might surprise you. Researchers gave out to participants\na rather enjoyable task like assembling the jigsaw puzzle or drawing and measured their motivation to do so. Then they\nintroduced small rewards for finishing the puzzle. Curiously, the participants were no longer as motivated as at the\nbeginning.</p>\n\n<p>The conclusion is that when we add an extrinsic motivation to an existing intrinsic one, we observe an overall decrease\nin willingness to do the activity!\nThis is what we call an undermining effect.</p>\n\n<p>The effect comes from the reward being perceived as the ultimate goal of the activity. When the reward comes at the end\nof the activity, only then is dopamine release activated, whereas it could be active during the whole time if only we\nmindfully focused on the joyful part of the activity itself. Introducing the reward leads to perceiving the whole\nexperience as less and less pleasurable over time.</p>\n\n<p>How to avoid the undermining effect? It’s rather simple. Don’t layer other sources of dopamine, avoid dopamine peaks\nright before and right after the activity and be mindful about your intrinsic motivation. But what if getting it done\nbecomes really hard? It is difficult to have intrinsic motivation at such times. A good tactic to try is\ntelling ourselves that overcoming those difficulties is a kind of pleasure, so we can activate our prefrontal cortex as\na part of the dopaminergic pathway and eventually get ourselves motivated.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"thinking-positively-practising-gratitude-meditation\">Thinking positively, practising gratitude, meditation</h4>\n\n<p>Remember that aspect of the mesocorticolimbic pathway where thinking about something enjoyable caused a dopamine\nrelease? There is more to it! By repeatedly having positive or negative interactions with something we can make a\nsignificant impact on its rewarding or non-rewarding properties. It effectively means that focusing on positive aspects\nof our surroundings and activities will eventually lead to an increase of dopamine releases from engaging with it.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, I would strongly encourage you to use different forms of appreciation or gratitude practice. Maybe try\njournaling a little at the end of the day? I dare you to think about 3 good things that happened to you at work every\nday and write it down.</p>\n\n<p>Research also shows that engaging in meditational practices leads to activation of reward-related areas of the brain.\nHaving a long-term habit of meditation and mindfulness will contribute to having sustained feelings of deep joy and\npeace, which is associated with higher dopamine levels.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>You now know how your dopamine mechanisms work and how to use your biological hardware\nto modulate your overall motivation. What you should remember is that the thing most important for your\nmotivation is maintaining a high baseline dopamine level. Avoid dopamine peaks, differentiate stimuli when you work,\nuse other tactics such as exposing yourself to cold water or meditation. Also, keep your focus\nmostly (preferably only) on your intrinsic motivation to avoid the undermining effect. Now, go conquer the world!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Lee W, Reeve J, Xue Y, Xiong J.

Sometimes these spikes of dopamine from listening\nto music or sweet treats are exactly what we need to get through the day. The key is to differentiate all these “extras”\nwhile we work. Listen to music while working — just not every time. Have that sweet drink — just not every day. Meet\nwith friends for a workout session — but also have these individual sessions once in a while.\nSome of us spend our time on meetings while trying to do our individual work at the same time. Some listen to podcasts\nwhile coding. We should keep in mind, though, that multitasking is another way of layering dopamine and doing that on a\ndaily basis will have a negative effect on general motivation.\n\nAnother factor we should keep in mind are distractions. Every email, every slack message, every push notification on\nyour phone will cause a small peak of dopamine. That makes it yet another thing to eliminate if you want to avoid\ndopamine layering.\nFocusing on intrinsic motivation\nWhen we look at the sources of motivation we can divide them in two groups — external sources, such as meeting\nexpectations of other people, fame or financial compensation and intrinsic sources, like enjoyment during an activity or\nfulfilling a personal mission.\nWhat do you like to do after work? Is it playing video games, playing music, baking, practising yoga or maybe watching\nlectures on mathematics on YouTube? (don’t judge me…) Whatever this would be, I bet no one needs to encourage you to do\nthis — you have an intrinsic drive to go and do your thing. You could spend hours on it, and then you’ll feel happy and\nfulfilled. This is how intrinsic motivation works — no external reward is required for you to feel motivated. Wouldn’t\nit be great if you had that in your job?\nResearch shows that intrinsic motivation brings better results than extrinsic motivation. One could ask a question —\nwhat if we brought those two things together? Well, the results might surprise you. Researchers gave out to participants\na rather enjoyable task like assembling the jigsaw puzzle or drawing and measured their motivation to do so. Then they\nintroduced small rewards for finishing the puzzle. Curiously, the participants were no longer as motivated as at the\nbeginning.\nThe conclusion is that when we add an extrinsic motivation to an existing intrinsic one, we observe an overall decrease\nin willingness to do the activity!\nThis is what we call an undermining effect.\nThe effect comes from the reward being perceived as the ultimate goal of the activity. When the reward comes at the end\nof the activity, only then is dopamine release activated, whereas it could be active during the whole time if only we\nmindfully focused on the joyful part of the activity itself. Introducing the reward leads to perceiving the whole\nexperience as less and less pleasurable over time.\nHow to avoid the undermining effect? It’s rather simple. Don’t layer other sources of dopamine, avoid dopamine peaks\nright before and right after the activity and be mindful about your intrinsic motivation. But what if getting it done\nbecomes really hard? It is difficult to have intrinsic motivation at such times. A good tactic to try is\ntelling ourselves that overcoming those difficulties is a kind of pleasure, so we can activate our prefrontal cortex as\na part of the dopaminergic pathway and eventually get ourselves motivated.\nThinking positively, practising gratitude, meditation\nRemember that aspect of the mesocorticolimbic pathway where thinking about something enjoyable caused a dopamine\nrelease? There is more to it! By repeatedly having positive or negative interactions with something we can make a\nsignificant impact on its rewarding or non-rewarding properties. It effectively means that focusing on positive aspects\nof our surroundings and activities will eventually lead to an increase of dopamine releases from engaging with it.\nHaving said that, I would strongly encourage you to use different forms of appreciation or gratitude practice. Maybe try\njournaling a little at the end of the day? I dare you to think about 3 good things that happened to you at work every\nday and write it down.\nResearch also shows that engaging in meditational practices leads to activation of reward-related areas of the brain.\nHaving a long-term habit of meditation and mindfulness will contribute to having sustained feelings of deep joy and\npeace, which is associated with higher dopamine levels.\nSummary\nYou now know how your dopamine mechanisms work and how to use your biological hardware\nto modulate your overall motivation. What you should remember is that the thing most important for your\nmotivation is maintaining a high baseline dopamine level. Avoid dopamine peaks, differentiate stimuli when you work,\nuse other tactics such as exposing yourself to cold water or meditation. Also, keep your focus\nmostly (preferably only) on your intrinsic motivation to avoid the undermining effect. Now, go conquer the world!\nReferences\nLee W, Reeve J, Xue Y, Xiong J.

This requires manual intervention which always worsens the user experience.\nAt the end of the day Cloud uses different primitives than software does and Infrastructure as Code can’t address that.\nYou don’t have atomic operations so provisioning a service can fail or land in an unknown state.\nYou also can’t run unit tests for infrastructure without actually running a deployment.\nIn essence you have a Schrödingers Cloud - you won’t be sure what will happen until you execute your change.\nThis contrasts with all that we know and came to love about software which we try to test in all possible scenarios.\nConclusion\nOur migration to Cloud is an ongoing process. This may be a never ending challenge as both Cloud and our organization evolve.\nWe needed to create a whole new environment that would be both flexible and invisible to the users.\nBy using some simple patterns and tools we encapsulated infrastructure provisioning in components used for microservices.\nAdditionally these components are testable and extendable which helps adapt to changes and users’ feedback.\nAt the moment of writing this the solution has been running in production for six months.\nMore than one thousand deployments have been made to production and countless more to dev and test.\nI hope this post will spark your creativity and inspire new ways of thinking about Cloud provisioning.","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/03/provisioning-cloud-infrastructure.html","categories":["java","k8s","cloud","gcp","terraform","iac"],"isoDate":"2023-03-09T23:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/java.png"},{"title":"Onion Architecture","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/02/onion-architecture.html","pubDate":"Mon, 13 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0100","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Tomasz Tarczyński"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/tomasz.tarczynski.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/tomasz.tarczynski"]}]},"content":"<p>Software Architecture is an elusive thing which, if neglected, can lead to a hard-to-develop and maintain codebase, and\nin more drastic circumstances to the failure of a product. This article discusses one of the backend application\narchitecture styles which proved to be successful in providing a good foundation for building and maintaining an\napplication in the long run: Onion Architecture.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"onion-architecture\">Onion Architecture</h2>\n\n<p>Onion Architecture is a software architectural style which strongly promotes the separation of concerns between the most\nimportant part of a business application — the domain code — and its technical aspects like HTTP or database. It does so\nwith ideas similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)\">Hexagonal Architecture</a>,\n<a href=\"/2021/12/clean-architecture-story.html\">Clean Architecture</a> and\n<a href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\">other related architecture styles</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This post gives a description of the ideas of Onion Architecture and discusses a sample implementation which explicitly\ndefines layers in the code and build setup.</p>\n\n<p>Additional complexity to the build setup and extra learning curve introduced by the layered approach pays back during\ndevelopment. It reduces the cognitive load on the programmer by giving a more concrete structural foundation and guidance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-repository\">The Repository</h3>\n\n<p>The code samples are taken from an example repository, which you can find\non <a href=\"https://github.com/tarczynskitomek/onion-library\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-does-software-architecture-matter\">Why does Software Architecture matter?</h3>\n\n<p>During my Engineering career, I’ve worked on multiple projects using different architectural styles. From a happy-go-lucky\napproach without any obvious structure, through “classic”<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> three-tier enterprise style, to highly structured\narchitecture, reflected by the setup of the build tool and supported by the compiler.</p>\n\n<p>The experience of working on those projects was also very different. Having to introduce a change in a shapeless blob of\nspaghetti code was always a painful experience, connected with stressful moments of <em>Have I broken something?</em> Or <em>Oh\nno! A gazillion of unrelated tests broke…</em></p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, working in a more rigid, but at the same time more expressive, and structured environment of\na well-architected application, was a breeze and a real pleasure. Not to mention that the time required to introduce the\nchange was smaller, and the estimates were more precise and predictable.</p>\n\n<p>Good architecture guides the implementation makes it easy to introduce new changes, and — to some degree — prevents\nless experienced team members from making doubtful decisions. It allows developers to focus on the value-providing\nimplementation rather than thinking <em>Hmm where should I put this class?</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, software architecture is often defined as <em>the things that are hard to change</em>, so choosing a proper\narchitectural approach to your new application is of key importance to its future development and maintenance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"about-the-onion\">About the Onion</h3>\n\n<p>The idea of Onion Architecture, first introduced by Jeffrey Palermo in\na <a href=\"https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/\">series of articles</a>, is similar to other clean\narchitecture approaches presented in Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin’s\n<a href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\">blog post</a>, his book\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164\">Clean Architecture</a>, and\nquite recently on our <a href=\"/2021/12/clean-architecture-story.html\">blog</a>. It can be successfully used as an alternative to a\npopular Hexagonal / Ports and Adapters architecture, and as such is predominantly used in the backend, business\napplications and services.</p>\n\n<p>The core concept in all the above styles is the same — to make the domain the most central part of the application, and\nremove all infrastructure concerns, such as talking via HTTP, messaging, database mapping, testing, etc., away from the\ndomain code. The core of the business logic should be free (in theory at least) from any of the technical, and\nframework-related problems, allowing for easy testing and rapid development.</p>\n\n<p>To put it using Uncle Bob’s words: <em>Though these architectures all vary somewhat in their details, they are very\nsimilar. They all have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns. They all achieve this separation by\ndividing the software into layers. Each has at least one layer for business rules, and another for interfaces</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The main difference I’ve found in the implementations of Hexagonal Architecture and Onion Architecture lies mostly in\nthe overall, more structured approach to the code layout of the latter. Both styles rely on the conscious usage of\ninterfaces, and the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Dependency Inversion Principle</code>, which is the layer and encapsulation, but the Onion, like a real vegetable, has explicitly defined layers. Making the concept a\nfirst-class citizen represented in the code guides implementation and gives more clear overall structure to the\ncodebase.</p>\n\n<p>This Architecture style does have some learning curve for developers in the project, but once mastered, pays back many\ntimes. Finally, as with every solution in the IT industry, it is not a one-size-fits-all, and you should always consider\nif the architectural style matches your needs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-onion-has-layers\">The Onion has Layers</h3>\n\n<p>Onion Architecture is a form of layered architecture. The main difference between “the classic” three-tier architecture\nand the Onion, is that every outer layer sees classes from all inner layers, not only the one directly below. Moreover,\nthe dependency direction always goes from the outside to the inside, never the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>But wait, what are the layers of Onion Architecture, what do they describe, and why do they matter?</p>\n\n<p>There are three<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> main layers in Onion Architecture:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The domain layer</li>\n  <li>The application layer</li>\n  <li>The infrastructure layer\neach of which has its responsibilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-02-13-onion-architecture/onion-layers.png\" alt=\"Onion Architecture Layers\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-domain-layer\">The Domain Layer</h4>\n\n<p>This is the layer where you place classes describing the core of your business.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s use a simple example. An application written to help manage a Library would most probably have classes like Book,\nReader, Copy and so on. The classes, relations and interactions between them describe the core of the domain of the\napplication, i.e. what business needs it fulfils and in what way. In the Library, there would be a process of adding new\ntitles to the catalogue, a process of borrowing and returning copies of a book, charging readers for overdue books, and\nmany more.</p>\n\n<p>A sample domain class could look like the one below:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-java highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>\n<span

Thus, it should not be concerned which database is used in the\nproject, nor should it know which communication style, synchronous RPC calls, asynchronous messaging, or a mix of is\nused to trigger the logic or maybe that it’s triggered by unit tests and not real user interactions. This doesn’t mean\nof course, that the domain classes can’t have any dependencies. Like it the example above — the code uses Lombok\nannotations, generating the boilerplate which otherwise needs to be written by the programmer.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-application-layer\">The Application Layer</h4>\n\n<p>This is the layer where you place your classes, which describe the use cases of the application and coordinate the work\nof the domain classes. For example, we can imagine that a new title added to the library undergoes an approval process:\nthe book is fetched from the repository, a timestamp of approval is generated, the book state (only new books can be\napproved) is checked, and if it’s OK, a modified book is then saved using the repository.</p>\n\n<p>The code describing such a use case can look like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-java highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Books</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// other fields and methods omitted</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"nc\">BookSnapshot</span> <span class=\"nf\">approve</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">BookId</span> <span class=\"n\">id</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">transactions</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">execute</span><span class=\"o\">(()</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"kd\">final</span> <span class=\"nc\">Book</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">bookRepository</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getById</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">id</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n            <span class=\"kd\">final</span> <span class=\"nc\">ApprovedAt</span> <span class=\"n\">approvedAt</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nc\">ApprovedAt</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">timeMachine</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">now</span><span class=\"o\">());</span>\n            <span class=\"kd\">final</span> <span class=\"nc\">Book</span> <span class=\"n\">approved</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">approve</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">approvedAt</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">bookRepository</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">update</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">approved</span><span class=\"o\">).</span><span class=\"na\">snapshot</span><span class=\"o\">();</span>\n        <span class=\"o\">});</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is also the layer that “knows” which operations should be performed atomically, thus the transaction-related code\nis placed here. Note, however, that in the example above, the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">transactions</code> field is actually an interface reference.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-java highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>\n<span class=\"nd\">@FunctionalInterface</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">interface</span> <span class=\"nc\">Transactions</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n\n    <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"no\">T</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"no\">T</span> <span class=\"nf\">execute</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">Supplier</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"no\">T</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">operation</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The application uses the <em>behaviour</em> expressed by the interface, the details of how the behaviour is executed lie in the\ninfrastructure layer.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-infrastructure-layer\">The Infrastructure Layer</h4>\n\n<p>This layer, the outermost layer of Onion, is a place where all framework and technology related stuff goes. It tends to\nbe the most “thick” since it contains the implementations of the interfaces defined in the inner layers.

This article discusses one of the backend application\narchitecture styles which proved to be successful in providing a good foundation for building and maintaining an\napplication in the long run: Onion Architecture.\nOnion Architecture\nOnion Architecture is a software architectural style which strongly promotes the separation of concerns between the most\nimportant part of a business application — the domain code — and its technical aspects like HTTP or database. It does so\nwith ideas similar to Hexagonal Architecture,\nClean Architecture and\nother related architecture styles.\nThis post gives a description of the ideas of Onion Architecture and discusses a sample implementation which explicitly\ndefines layers in the code and build setup.\nAdditional complexity to the build setup and extra learning curve introduced by the layered approach pays back during\ndevelopment. It reduces the cognitive load on the programmer by giving a more concrete structural foundation and guidance.\nThe Repository\nThe code samples are taken from an example repository, which you can find\non GitHub.\nWhy does Software Architecture matter?\nDuring my Engineering career, I’ve worked on multiple projects using different architectural styles. From a happy-go-lucky\napproach without any obvious structure, through “classic”1 three-tier enterprise style, to highly structured\narchitecture, reflected by the setup of the build tool and supported by the compiler.\nThe experience of working on those projects was also very different. Having to introduce a change in a shapeless blob of\nspaghetti code was always a painful experience, connected with stressful moments of Have I broken something? Or Oh\nno! A gazillion of unrelated tests broke…\nOn the other hand, working in a more rigid, but at the same time more expressive, and structured environment of\na well-architected application, was a breeze and a real pleasure. Not to mention that the time required to introduce the\nchange was smaller, and the estimates were more precise and predictable.\nGood architecture guides the implementation makes it easy to introduce new changes, and — to some degree — prevents\nless experienced team members from making doubtful decisions. It allows developers to focus on the value-providing\nimplementation rather than thinking Hmm where should I put this class?.\nLast but not least, software architecture is often defined as the things that are hard to change, so choosing a proper\narchitectural approach to your new application is of key importance to its future development and maintenance.\nAbout the Onion\nThe idea of Onion Architecture, first introduced by Jeffrey Palermo in\na series of articles, is similar to other clean\narchitecture approaches presented in Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin’s\nblog post, his book\nClean Architecture, and\nquite recently on our blog. It can be successfully used as an alternative to a\npopular Hexagonal / Ports and Adapters architecture, and as such is predominantly used in the backend, business\napplications and services.\nThe core concept in all the above styles is the same — to make the domain the most central part of the application, and\nremove all infrastructure concerns, such as talking via HTTP, messaging, database mapping, testing, etc., away from the\ndomain code. The core of the business logic should be free (in theory at least) from any of the technical, and\nframework-related problems, allowing for easy testing and rapid development.\nTo put it using Uncle Bob’s words: Though these architectures all vary somewhat in their details, they are very\nsimilar. They all have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns. They all achieve this separation by\ndividing the software into layers. Each has at least one layer for business rules, and another for interfaces.\nThe main difference I’ve found in the implementations of Hexagonal Architecture and Onion Architecture lies mostly in\nthe overall, more structured approach to the code layout of the latter. Both styles rely on the conscious usage of\ninterfaces, and the Dependency Inversion Principle, which is the layer and encapsulation, but the Onion, like a real vegetable, has explicitly defined layers. Making the concept a\nfirst-class citizen represented in the code guides implementation and gives more clear overall structure to the\ncodebase.\nThis Architecture style does have some learning curve for developers in the project, but once mastered, pays back many\ntimes. Finally, as with every solution in the IT industry, it is not a one-size-fits-all, and you should always consider\nif the architectural style matches your needs.\nThe Onion has Layers\nOnion Architecture is a form of layered architecture. The main difference between “the classic” three-tier architecture\nand the Onion, is that every outer layer sees classes from all inner layers, not only the one directly below. Moreover,\nthe dependency direction always goes from the outside to the inside, never the other way around.\nBut wait, what are the layers of Onion Architecture, what do they describe, and why do they matter?\nThere are three2 main layers in Onion Architecture:\nThe domain layer\nThe application layer\nThe infrastructure layer\neach of which has its responsibilities.\n\nThe Domain Layer\nThis is the layer where you place classes describing the core of your business.\nLet’s use a simple example. An application written to help manage a Library would most probably have classes like Book,\nReader, Copy and so on. The classes, relations and interactions between them describe the core of the domain of the\napplication, i.e. what business needs it fulfils and in what way. In the Library, there would be a process of adding new\ntitles to the catalogue, a process of borrowing and returning copies of a book, charging readers for overdue books, and\nmany more.\nA sample domain class could look like the one below:\n\n\n@ToString\n@EqualsAndHashCode(of = \"id\")\n@AllArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PRIVATE)\nabstract sealed class Book {\n\n    protected final BookId id;\n    protected final Version version;\n    protected final AuthorId author;\n    protected final Title title;\n    protected final CreatedAt createdAt;\n    protected final ApprovedAt approvedAt;\n    protected final RejectedAt rejectedAt;\n    protected final ArchivedAt archivedAt;\n\n    // static factory method for assembling a new instance of a Book — hides the internal representation\n    static Book create(AuthorId author, Title title, CreatedAt createdAt) {\n        return new NewBook(BookId.next(), Version.first(), author, title, createdAt);\n    }\n\n    // One of the subclasses representing the current state of the book entity\n    // Other subclasses omitted for brevity.\n    private static final class NewBook extends Book {\n\n        private NewBook(BookId id, Version version, AuthorId author, Title title, CreatedAt createdAt) {\n            super(id, version, author, title, createdAt, null, null, null);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        protected BookSnapshot.Status status() {\n            return BookSnapshot.Status.AWAITING_APPROVAL;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        Book approve(ApprovedAt approvedAt) {\n            return new ApprovedBook(id, version, author, title, createdAt, approvedAt);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        Book reject(RejectedAt rejectedAt) {\n            return new RejectedBook(id, version, author, title, createdAt, rejectedAt);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Available domain operations\n    Book approve(ApprovedAt approvedAt) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Unsupported state transition. Cannot approve book in state [%s]\"\n                .formatted(status()));\n    }\n\n    Book reject(RejectedAt rejectedAt) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Unsupported state transition. Cannot reject book in state [%s]\"\n                .formatted(status()));\n    }\n\n    Book archive(ArchivedAt archivedAt) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\n                \"Unsupported state transition. Cannot archive book in state [%s]\".formatted(status())\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n\nSince the domain changes the most — here is the place where you put all the new features, and business requirements — it\nshould be as easy as possible to modify and test. Thus, it should not be concerned which database is used in the\nproject, nor should it know which communication style, synchronous RPC calls, asynchronous messaging, or a mix of is\nused to trigger the logic or maybe that it’s triggered by unit tests and not real user interactions. This doesn’t mean\nof course, that the domain classes can’t have any dependencies. Like it the example above — the code uses Lombok\nannotations, generating the boilerplate which otherwise needs to be written by the programmer.\nThe Application Layer\nThis is the layer where you place your classes, which describe the use cases of the application and coordinate the work\nof the domain classes. For example, we can imagine that a new title added to the library undergoes an approval process:\nthe book is fetched from the repository, a timestamp of approval is generated, the book state (only new books can be\napproved) is checked, and if it’s OK, a modified book is then saved using the repository.\nThe code describing such a use case can look like this:\n\nclass Books {\n    // other fields and methods omitted\n    public BookSnapshot approve(BookId id) {\n        return transactions.execute(() -> {\n            final Book book = bookRepository.getById(id);\n            final ApprovedAt approvedAt = new ApprovedAt(timeMachine.now());\n            final Book approved = book.approve(approvedAt);\n            return bookRepository.update(approved).snapshot();\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThis is also the layer that “knows” which operations should be performed atomically, thus the transaction-related code\nis placed here. Note, however, that in the example above, the transactions field is actually an interface reference.\n\n\n@FunctionalInterface\npublic interface Transactions {\n\n    <T> T execute(Supplier<T> operation);\n}\n\n\nThe application uses the behaviour expressed by the interface, the details of how the behaviour is executed lie in the\ninfrastructure layer.\nThe Infrastructure Layer\nThis layer, the outermost layer of Onion, is a place where all framework and technology related stuff goes. It tends to\nbe the most “thick” since it contains the implementations of the interfaces defined in the inner layers. Need an\nHTTP controller, a message listener or a database adapter (an implementation of repository interface defined at the domain layer)? Infrastructure is the place to go.\nThe domain, although the most important part of the application, tends to be also the smallest in terms of code size.\nThe reverse is true about the infrastructure code — all the supporting mechanisms, which are placed at the\ninfrastructure layer, are the backbone which animates the domain behaviour, and as such that part of the service should\nnot be neglected.\nStaying with the example of the Transactions interface, let’s take a look at possible implementations. A simple approach\nusing Spring’s programmatic transaction handling could look like this:\n\n\n@Component\n@AllArgsConstructor\nclass JdbcTransactions implements Transactions {\n\n    private final TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate;\n\n    @Override\n    public <T> T execute(Supplier<T> operation) {\n        return transactionTemplate.execute(status -> operation.get());\n    }\n}\n\n\nand for unit test, one can set up a fake, noop implementation:\n\nclass NoOpTransactionsFake implements Transactions {\n\n    @Override\n    <T> T execute(Supplier<T> operation) {\n        operation.get()\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe Flavours of The Onion or how to represent layers in code?\nThere are two basic approaches to representing the layers in the code. The one that we used in our most recent\nproject was to use a package naming convention.\n\nEvery domain package has three subpackages: domain, application and infrastructure. This method is clear, easy to\nunderstand and navigate, and does not require changes to the build tool setup. The downside is that, except for the\nagreed convention, and Code Review process to check them, there is no mechanism preventing you from using a class\ndefined in the application layer in the domain layer, thus breaking the direction of the dependencies. One can always\nuse such tools as ArchUnit to write tests checking if there are no “prohibited” imports,\nbut in my opinion, we can do better by employing build tool modules support.\nBuild tools to the rescue\nThe more involved approach is to define compilation modules representing the layers. Its disadvantage is a more\ncomplicated build structure and setup of your build tool of choice. On the other side though, having the compiler on\nyour side is very helpful, and prevents the above-mentioned issue. The direction of the dependencies between layers is\nclearly defined in the module build files.\n\n// settings.gradle\nrootProject.name = 'onion'\n\ninclude('domain', 'application', 'infrastructure')\n\n\nUsing Gradle setup as an example, one can define three modules — domain, application, and infrastructure —\nin settings.gradle file. Then, in the build files corresponding to each of the modules, declare their dependencies,\nclearly defining the direction of dependencies.\n\n// /application/build.gradle\ndependencies {\n    implementation(project(':domain'))\n}\n// /infrastructure/build.gradle\nplugins {\n    id 'org.springframework.boot'\n    id 'io.spring.dependency-management'\n    id 'com.revolut.jooq-docker' version '0.3.7'\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(project(':domain'))\n    implementation(project(':application'))\n\n    implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')\n    implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-jooq')\n\n    // other dependencies and settings removed for brevity\n}\n\n\nNotice, that the biggest file is the one for the infrastructure layer. It should not be a surprise by now. The\ninfrastructure has all the framework — in this case Spring Boot — database driver, and other dependencies, and itself\ndepends on both domain and application. There’s of course nothing preventing you from declaring extra dependencies,\nsay Lombok.

The first would load when the user opens the app and would be available immediately.\nAnd the second part would load when the user scrolls to the end of the first part.\nThis technique is called lazy loading.\nIt is not something new, it is used web-wide in many places, but in our case, we had to think about it differently because …\n… we built the Allego homepage in applications using MBox, the server-driven UI solution created at Allegro, which means that the content and screen logic is defined entirely on the server side.\nImplementation of lazy loading for the Allegro homepage also had to be done on the server side.\nWhat is MBox?
