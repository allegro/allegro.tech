Every time when somebody wanted to use a button, input, link etc., they would have to include a mixin for it pulling the entire set of CSS rules to their stylesheet. This resulted in our users downloading unnecessary kilobytes during the first visit while bringing no caching benefit when navigating through other pages which in turn increased rendering times. We knew we could do better.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"enter-css-modules\">Enter CSS Modules</h3>\n\n<p>After a lot of brainstorming, a decision was made that the next step should involve Metrum making use of CSS Modules. While the technical aspects and usage were changing as the adoption grew, the main principles stayed the same up to this day. Currently, whenever any developer wants to assemble a new component out of Metrum building blocks, they can install desired packages, compose styles from them and declare used classes in their markup:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-scss highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nc\">.button</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">composes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">m-button</span> <span class=\"n\">from</span> <span class=\"s1\">'@metrum/button'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">composes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">m-background-color-black</span> <span class=\"n\">from</span> <span class=\"s1\">'@metrum/color'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"nx\">styles</span> <span class=\"k\">from</span> <span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">./styles.css</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">export</span> <span class=\"k\">default</span> <span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">render</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"s2\">`\n        &lt;button class=\"</span><span class=\"p\">${</span><span class=\"nx\">styles</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">button</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"&gt;...&lt;/button&gt;\n    `</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Thanks to the fact that all of our micro frontends run on Node.js, this approach can be used quite easily with the majority of tooling available. The only thing left to do is to collect all of the required Metrum stylesheets during render in our facade server called opbox-web and embed them on the page with the correct order. Ordering requirement is important, because we follow atomic design and more complicated components (molecules, organisms) are built using simpler ones (atoms). Lets see what all of those changes did to our list of tradeoffs:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Still easy to use — install package and compose desired classes in your component;</li>\n  <li>Sharing classes means sharing visual traits which was one of our goals;</li>\n  <li>Styles for certain module only appear once per page if used in multiple components;</li>\n  <li>Each Metrum stylesheet can be cached by the browser separately and reused on different pages;</li>\n  <li>Developers can still use packages in any version without depending on other parts of the page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Additional logic has to be maintained that extracts needed Metrum stylesheets from components and adds them to the page once;</li>\n  <li>Above logic has to also take care of sorting so the order of styles is correct and we don’t run into problems with cascade;</li>\n  <li>Multiple versions of the same Metrum component may be needed on the page;</li>\n  <li>More and more requests have to be made as components transition to the new approach.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Judging from the upsides the transition was worth it: despite higher maintenance effort we were finally able to share common CSS code between components, the amount of downloaded data as well as render times started decreasing. Unfortunately, after some time we started to see a worrying trend related to the number of embedded stylesheets. Prior to this change, it was roughly equal to the number of components used on the page. Afterwards, with additional Metrum modules, plus the fact that multiple versions of them may be needed, we ended up with as much as around 100 requests for render-blocking CSS.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, when we bring up the issue of excessive number of requests people respond with “So what? You have HTTP/2, right?” and yes, we do. It’s true that the user agent will reuse existing connections for multiple files but the limit of concurrent streams does exist, latency is still going to affect each one of them and the compression efficiency will be worse especially for those relatively small files like ours. We had to come up with yet another idea for improvement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"let-the-bundle-begin\">Let the Bundle Begin</h3>\n\n<p>As I touched briefly earlier, we have the opbox-web — a place that’s already responsible for extracting, sorting and embedding Metrum dependencies. We figured that instead of adding each of them separately, we could prepare predefined bundles that would serve as replacements. We did as planned and, after deployment on 6th of July 2020, achieved 15% improvement in FCP metric time, which means that our users saw the first render of content faster by almost half a second.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-07-29-css-architecture-and-performance-of-micro-frontends/fcp-after-metrum-bundle.png\" alt=\"FCP metric chart before and after deployment of Metrum bundle\" title=\"FCP metric chart before and after deployment of Metrum bundle\" /></p>\n\n<p>Improvement was satisfactory, but it came at a certain cost. From that time on we had to make sure all of the components used on a certain page share the same versions of Metrum modules supported by the bundle and I assure you, it was bothersome to say the least. Monitoring that nobody updated their dependency by accident was one thing (especially that we managed to automate it) but undergoing a process of actually wanting to do this was another. In addition, every time we failed within that area we had to bail and serve every stylesheet separately, preventing incorrect order of CSS and bringing performance to the previous low.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>CSS Modules usage stayed the same;</li>\n  <li>Fewer requests for critical resources resulted in noticeable improvement in FCP metric.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Extra work is needed to keep Metrum packages versions aligned;</li>\n  <li>Updating Metrum dependencies becomes much harder as it requires synchronization between all of the components on a certain page;</li>\n  <li>All of the above meant that we only managed to enable this feature on the most popular of routes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We knew there was going to be additional effort to maintain this solution but the performance gains outweighed the cost at that time. It took almost a year of tedious work from multiple teams to keep the look and feel of Allegro up to date with newest changes, until we came up with another idea.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"just-in-time-bundling\">Just In Time Bundling</h3>\n\n<p>In the beginning of 2021 another idea started to form. This time we wanted to unlock the agile nature of our Micro Frontends and their deployment. We came to the conclusion that it would be ideal if instead of serving bundles containing a predefined list of components, we could send one composed of just the files that were actually required to render a certain page. Collecting the list of CSS that’s needed was not the problem — we were generating the HEAD section after all — but generating these unique bundles, well that was something different.</p>\n\n<p>First option we had to verify was the possibility to prepare all of the bundles beforehand so they can be picked and served from CDN. Sadly, taking into account that there are around 500 components, any of which can either be used as a building block of a certain page or not, gives us 2<sup>500</sup> combinations which is way more than we can handle. Even if we optimistically assumed that each stylesheet required around 50ms to generate, it would take us roughly 5x10<sup>141</sup> years to cover everything. Additionally, it would not only be a waste of time and storage (some components have higher possibility to be used than others) but also at least a portion of the work would have to be redone every time a component is updated, what can happen multiple times a day.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we went with a different approach by implementing a bundler microservice. Its operating principle can be explained in a few steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>When user makes a request for a page, our server collects a list of CSS files that would normally be added to the HEAD section;</li>\n  <li>It sends this list of files to our microservice asking for an URL to the corresponding bundle that contains them;</li>\n  <li>The microservice checks if it has the bundle in its cache:\n    <ol>\n      <li>If it does, then bundle URL is immediately returned;</li>\n      <li>Otherwise, it also responds right away with empty result, triggering bundle generation in the background;</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>Based on the response from the microservice, the server either embeds separate CSS files as usual or replaces them with a single bundle.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is where we are now – generating only what is actually needed and keeping the duration overhead minimal. A lot of thought and multiple iterations went into making it possible, so I think you can expect a completely separate article about this microservice in the future.

Otherwise, we might end up with confused users and\ndecreased conversion. Although the stakes are high, it is still very likely to encounter an application designed with only a happy path scenario in\nmind. The question is - how can we improve it?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"make-the-request-state-visible\">Make the request state visible</h3>\n<p>Back in the old days submitting a form would result in a full page reload. Until the page was ready, there was a clear sign that something was happening. If\nsomething went wrong typically there was an unstyled generic error message.</p>\n\n<p>This approach served its purpose very well - it was easy to tell that the page was still loading and it was easy to tell when there was an error. Then\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX\">AJAX</a> became popular, bringing with its benefits also certain drawbacks - it was up to the\nprogrammer to handle loading and error state indicators, which were often omitted. To prevent user’s confusion, you should always remember about\nclearly presenting the request state to the user.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"retry-failed-requests\">Retry failed requests</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, errors do happen sometimes. Usually, users are faced with a message and an option to retry the request. This approach is far better than\nfailing silently and not informing the user, but still can lead to abandoned actions. Maybe we can do better than that?</p>\n\n<p>What if instead of asking the user to retry the failed request, we could do it automatically? There is another follow-up question: is every request worth\nretrying? Imagine a server responding with status code <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403\">403 (forbidden)</a>,\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/422\">422 (unprocessable entity)</a>, or 4xx in general. These are the client’s faults and usually\nretrying those requests will yield the same result. Now let’s consider 5xx status codes, which are often caused by temporary database unavailability or server\nresource exhaustion. Especially in multi-server environments, chances are that the next request will be rerouted to a healthy instance, resulting in a\nsuccessful response.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in case of increased traffic, repeating failed requests instantly could possibly make things worse. In order to prevent that, it is a good\npractice to introduce an exponential delay between consecutive retry attempts. Another solution, more common in inter-service communication, is a circuit breaker\nmechanism which prevents further requests until service becomes available.</p>\n\n<p>Also, keep in mind that network conditions might not be stable, particularly on mobile devices. If there is no connection, instead of making pointless API\ncalls you could queue the requests and observe\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/Online_and_offline_events\">online/offline events</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, not every request is safe to retry. Sometimes when you receive 5xx, there is no guarantee that it has not been processed. Imagine retrying a request\nto make a money transfer from one account to another - handling it twice would be a disaster!

Otherwise, we might end up with confused users and\ndecreased conversion. Although the stakes are high, it is still very likely to encounter an application designed with only a happy path scenario in\nmind. The question is - how can we improve it?\nMake the request state visible\nBack in the old days submitting a form would result in a full page reload. Until the page was ready, there was a clear sign that something was happening. If\nsomething went wrong typically there was an unstyled generic error message.\nThis approach served its purpose very well - it was easy to tell that the page was still loading and it was easy to tell when there was an error. Then\nAJAX became popular, bringing with its benefits also certain drawbacks - it was up to the\nprogrammer to handle loading and error state indicators, which were often omitted. To prevent user’s confusion, you should always remember about\nclearly presenting the request state to the user.\nRetry failed requests\nAs mentioned above, errors do happen sometimes. Usually, users are faced with a message and an option to retry the request. This approach is far better than\nfailing silently and not informing the user, but still can lead to abandoned actions. Maybe we can do better than that?\nWhat if instead of asking the user to retry the failed request, we could do it automatically? There is another follow-up question: is every request worth\nretrying? Imagine a server responding with status code 403 (forbidden),\n422 (unprocessable entity), or 4xx in general. These are the client’s faults and usually\nretrying those requests will yield the same result. Now let’s consider 5xx status codes, which are often caused by temporary database unavailability or server\nresource exhaustion. Especially in multi-server environments, chances are that the next request will be rerouted to a healthy instance, resulting in a\nsuccessful response.\nOn the other hand, in case of increased traffic, repeating failed requests instantly could possibly make things worse. In order to prevent that, it is a good\npractice to introduce an exponential delay between consecutive retry attempts. Another solution, more common in inter-service communication, is a circuit breaker\nmechanism which prevents further requests until service becomes available.\nAlso, keep in mind that network conditions might not be stable, particularly on mobile devices. If there is no connection, instead of making pointless API\ncalls you could queue the requests and observe\nonline/offline events.\nFinally, not every request is safe to retry. Sometimes when you receive 5xx, there is no guarantee that it has not been processed. Imagine retrying a request\nto make a money transfer from one account to another - handling it twice would be a disaster! In order to prevent these mistakes from happening, you have to\nmake sure your API is idempotent. This is usually achieved by using adequate HTTP methods\n(like PUT) or passing an additional identifier with the request.\nDo not wait forever\nHave you ever wondered how long it takes before an API call times out due to no response from the server? If not, I have bad news for you -\nthe default timeout value in XMLHttpRequest is 0, which basically means the browser will wait forever.\nWith fetch there is no parameter responsible for timeouts - it relies on browser defaults (which\nis 300 seconds for Chrome and\nFirefox.\nThe good news is that you can actually implement timeout functionality using\nAbortController:\n\nconst controller = new AbortController();\nconst timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 3000); // 3s timeout\n\nfetch(\"/api/something\", { signal: controller.signal })\n  .then(response => {\n    clearTimeout(timeout);\n    // process the response\n  });\n\n\nAnother useful application of AbortController is cancelling straggler requests (requests still in progress at a point when the response is no longer needed).\nThis is particularly useful in libraries like React where receiving a response after unmounting a component results in an error:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const controller = new AbortController();\n\n  fetch(\"/api/something\", { signal: controller.signal })\n    .then(response => {\n      // process the response\n    });\n\n  return () => controller.abort(); // cancel the request when un-mounting the component\n}, []);\n\n\nBe optimistic\nAs funny as it may sound, there is an actual pattern called “optimistic UI”. The idea behind it is very straightforward: given that most of the time an API\nrequest will result in a successful response, we can skip the “loading” part and go straight to a result stage. In the unlikely event of failure, we can still\nrollback our changes and inform the user about the error.\nLet’s consider a popular example of a counter (eg. Facebook/Twitter like button). For the sake of simplicity I will skip the actual request and return a\npromise after 1 second so that approximately 25% of requests will fail:\n\nCounter value: <span id=\"counter\">0</span> <button id=\"button\">Increase</button>\n\n<script>\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  const updateView = () => document.querySelector(\"#counter\").innerText = counter;\n\n  const makeRequest = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const outcome = Math.random() > 0.25 ? resolve : reject;\n    setTimeout(outcome, 1000);\n  });\n\n  document.querySelector(\"#button\").addEventListener(\"click\", async () => {\n    counter++;\n    updateView();\n\n    try {\n      await makeRequest();\n    } catch (e) {\n      counter--;\n      updateView();\n    }\n  });\n</script>\n\n\nBy simply assuming the positive outcome we drastically reduce the amount of time spent on the interactions, making the whole experience more swift.

We were curious whether this tool had\nmore advantages in comparison to traditional Apache Spark. We wanted to find the answer relatively quickly with minimal effort. Hence, we built two projects to\nprocess the same data using these technologies. Below you can get to know the architecture of the jobs written in Apache Spark and Apache Beam.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Given: 4 input tables (~2.5 TB/day).</li>\n  <li>Task: join and clean data.</li>\n  <li>Result: 4 output tables.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-06-28-1-task-2-solutions-spark-or-beam/bigdata-projects-architecture.png\" alt=\"scripting\" /></p>\n\n<p>Note: Below I described our solution and used tools and technologies which do not pretend to be 100% the right approach so your results might be different.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"programming-model\">Programming model</h3>\n\n<p>The first comparison is about showing the way these technologies are built as capturing the general concept plays the first role in writing the code for data\nprocessing.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Based on the in-memory <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce\">MapReduce</a> model evolved from Hadoop MapReduce. This fact forces developers\n        to take care more of executors' memory, as mapping operations occur there. And you still need to remember about shuffling at the Join moment and how to\n        split data to make right repartitioning (too big data chunk causes overloading on machines, too small means more shuffling over the net). How did we tune\n        this job? The only way we knew how to do it was applying some \"a-la best practices\" Spark configurations, running the job with production data volume\n        (just imagine how it reflects machine resource cost!), looking at the metrics and crossing fingers that executors will stand. Finally after n-th attempt\n        it started working.\n        </td>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        It pretends to be a unified processing model. What does it mean? Apache Beam is based on so-called abstract pipelines that can be run on different\n        executors (you can even switch to the Spark execution environment). In our case we're using a DataFlow runner. This pipeline includes every stage of\n        processing starting from data fetching, transformation, ending with the result output. With these pipelines Apache Beam hides low-level things like\n        shuffling, repartitioning, etc. from the developer. Additionally we used <a href=\"https://github.com/allegro/bigflow\">BigFlow</a> open-source framework\n        developed internally in Allegro which is built to support Apache Beam data processing technology (simplifies building packages, configuration and\n        deployment processes).\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Apache Beam looks more like a framework as it abstracts the complexity of processing and hides technical details, and Spark is the\ntechnology where you literally need to dive deeper.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"programming-languages-and-build-tools\">Programming languages and build tools</h3>\n\n<p>Here I do not want to spread hate and discuss which programming language is the best one for data processing, it is the matter of taste.

We were curious whether this tool had\nmore advantages in comparison to traditional Apache Spark. We wanted to find the answer relatively quickly with minimal effort. Hence, we built two projects to\nprocess the same data using these technologies. Below you can get to know the architecture of the jobs written in Apache Spark and Apache Beam.\nGiven: 4 input tables (~2.5 TB/day).\nTask: join and clean data.\nResult: 4 output tables.\n\nNote: Below I described our solution and used tools and technologies which do not pretend to be 100% the right approach so your results might be different.\nProgramming model\nThe first comparison is about showing the way these technologies are built as capturing the general concept plays the first role in writing the code for data\nprocessing.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nMapReduce model evolved from Hadoop MapReduce. This fact forces developers\n        to take care more of executors' memory, as mapping operations occur there. And you still need to remember about shuffling at the Join moment and how to\n        split data to make right repartitioning (too big data chunk causes overloading on machines, too small means more shuffling over the net). How did we tune\n        this job? The only way we knew how to do it was applying some \"a-la best practices\" Spark configurations, running the job with production data volume\n        (just imagine how it reflects machine resource cost!), looking at the metrics and crossing fingers that executors will stand. Finally after n-th attempt\n        it started working.\n        \n        \n        It pretends to be a unified processing model. What does it mean? Apache Beam is based on so-called abstract pipelines that can be run on different\n        executors (you can even switch to the Spark execution environment). In our case we're using a DataFlow runner. This pipeline includes every stage of\n        processing starting from data fetching, transformation, ending with the result output. With these pipelines Apache Beam hides low-level things like\n        shuffling, repartitioning, etc. from the developer. Additionally we used BigFlow open-source framework\n        developed internally in Allegro which is built to support Apache Beam data processing technology (simplifies building packages, configuration and\n        deployment processes).\n        \n    \nSummary: Apache Beam looks more like a framework as it abstracts the complexity of processing and hides technical details, and Spark is the\ntechnology where you literally need to dive deeper.\nProgramming languages and build tools\nHere I do not want to spread hate and discuss which programming language is the best one for data processing, it is the matter of taste. I just would like to\nprovide some context of our team’s background to give you better understanding of our preferences: most of us are specialised in the software development in\nKotlin so we were a little bit biased against non JVM-based languages before starting this task.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nAirflow\n        (the tool which automates running the job in the cluster).\n        \n        \n        Natively available in Java and Python, but since we took advantage of the BigFlow framework, Python was used for everything.\n        \n    \nsbt is used for building the package and running the tests. This can be more beneficial for\n        Java developers who are familiar with Gradle: it uses the build.sbt configuration file, which like build.gradle declares dependencies, the Scala version\n        to use, etc.\n        \n        \n        Setuptools (tool for building Python packages) is run by script.py build script\n        provided by BigFlow. This framework also provides an additional mechanism for managing dependencies which is based on the standard\n        pip-tool. Additionally running tests with BigFlow CLI is more convenient and faster compared with sbt.\n        \n    \nSummary: Scala is much closer to our team (mostly Java developers), especially at the beginning when we needed to get used to working with Python\nwithout static typing. Also Scala is more natural for Spark, so all upcoming features will be firstly supported for this programming language, educational\nresources and examples in Scala for Spark are more exhaustive.\nBatch and stream data processing\nIn our projects we did not implement stream data processing, since we have batch processing only, but anyway it is probable that business requirements could\nchange so we must also consider how to do it in a better way.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nSummary: although we didn’t try it ourselves, we’d bet on Apache Beam in this comparison. It looks more adapted for Streaming than Spark.\nAlthough there is a streaming extension since Spark 2.2 but libraries of streaming functions are quite limited. For us this means more efforts to apply.\nTesting\nAlong with the development process these projects were getting more complicated - so we realized the unit testing is not enough to make us feel safe. So below\nare our researches how to ensure the jobs will be able to handle big load in a production environment.\n\n        Apache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nUnit tests (local environment without access to real infrastructure, validation of business logic)\n        \n        Embedded Spark\n        \n        \n        TestPipeline\n        \n    \nIntegration tests (validation of proper reads/writes from/to BigQuery)\n        No official support for mocking BigQuery/Google Storage or embedded/test container version\n    \nE2E tests (ensure job is executed, run in Cloud and has integration with GCP infrastructure)\n        \n        Due to the missing implementation of testing the whole flow, we were running locally jobs to load production data, process them and store into BigQuery\n        tables for development purposes. This way we were ensuring introduced changes did not impact performance and both return identical results.\n        Note: recently BigFlow added a solution by setting real Dataflow/BigQuery\n        infrastructure while running E2E tests\n        \n    \nSummary: a solution is to minimize the ratio of missing test coverage and isolate classes responsible for I/O operations to external storages\n(Google Storage and BigQuery) as much as possible. Big issue is to provide these dependencies while running tests inside CI pipeline but this is completely\nanother story. In both cases, it is not trivial task. So, for the sake of simplicity we were ensuring there are no performance issues and jobs are not broken by\nrunning them on a dev environment using the production data which also took us a lot of time.\nLocal run\nLocal run in our case does not mean 100% execution on the laptop: job is triggered from the local machine, but actually it has a place on the real cluster\nin Google Cloud.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nSummary: no absolute winner here, depends on your preferences. Beside this we found Terraform to be a fine separate tool to set up a local\nenvironment for running the job and could be used for Apache Beam job as well.\nRunning on the GCP\nOnce we are done with the local development, we are good to go to the Cloud! However, even here, not everything is so clear as we have two services to run our\njobs and we described our considerations about them below.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nDataproc (Hadoop under the hood which is required to run Spark).

I like to log as much extra data as possible, and I’m\nfond of logging.debug entries.\nI’m also a DRY approach believer. I feel strong anxiety when I see repetition in code.\nAnd my mind literally hangs when I need to do Ctrl-C/V, even if it’s justified by\ncircumstances. In such cases I start to focus on getting rid of copy-pastes instead of\nwriting new code.\nCombining all these “passions” is not always easy. It’s hard to log everything without\nrepeating things. Even if it’s possible, it usually leads to inelegant code.\nFor example, if you want to log that some error occured:\n\nlogger.error('Foo happened: %s', e)\n\n\nThen so far it’s clean and easy.\nIt would be nice to add some extra details though, like user\n(then you could search by user in Kibana, if your logs goes there):\n\nlogger.error('Foo happened: %s', e, extra={'user': user,\n                                           'action_type': 'bar'})\n\n\nNext, during debugging of a problem, you will notice that it’s not nearly enough and it’s worth\nadding some logging.debug\n\nlogger.debug(\"We're going to do SOMETHING in thread\",\n             extra={'user': user,\n                    'action_type': 'bar',\n                    'thread_num': thread_num})\n\n\nAfter that you will notice that your code has extra= with duplicated user and action_type.\nIt’s a Bad Thing! Imagine what would happen if there was another logger.debug, and another?\nLots of repeated code that should be written only once…\n\nSo in other words, the more details you log, the more cumbersome the code. What can we\ndo?\nMethod 1: don’t log extra\nIt’s not what I like. I do want to log them!\nMethod 2: store extra in a variable\nIt’s what I used to do sometimes, before LogExtraCtx. It could go like that:\n\nextra = {'user': user, 'action_type': 'bar'}\n\nlogger.debug(\"We're going to do SOMETHING in thread\",\n             extra=dict(thread_num=thread_num, **extra))\n\nlogger.error('Foo happened: %s', e, extra=extra)\n\n\nQuite tricky and not very elegant.\nMethod 3: use LogExtraCtx\nBefore I describe the aforementioned library, let me show you a more realistic example.\nConsider the following code:\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n\ndef send_message(requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Function send_message sends message to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"\n    try:\n        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},\n                          ... < other params > ....)\n        r.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error('Sending message failed. Response text: \"%s\"', e,\n                     extra={  # extra data to be logged and indexed by Kibana\n                         'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                         'requester': requester,\n                         'recipient': recipient,\n                     })\n        return False\n    logger.info('Sending MSG success.',\n                extra={  # the same extra data to be logged/indexed\n                    'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                    'requester': requester,\n                    'recipient': recipient,\n                })\n    return True\n\n\nThere are two log entries, both with extra data for easy-finding in Kibana (there is a bit\nof redundancy in the code, so I already feel the desire to DRY it).\nThen I need to add additional logging:\n\nlogger.debug(\"headers=%r\", r.result.headers,\n             extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                    'requester': requester,\n                    'recipient': recipient\n                    })\n\n\nAnd then, I need even more context in every log entry:\n\nextra = {'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n         'requester': requester,\n         'recipient': recipient,\n         'user': str(request.user),\n         'environment': env_type,\n         }\n\n\nCombined all together, it becomes a big, unreadable blob of code. A very simple piece of logic has been\nspoiled by 3 log entries.\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n\ndef send_message(environment: str, requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Function send_message sends MSG to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"\n    try:\n        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},\n                          ... < other params > ....)\n        r.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error('Sending MSG failed. Response text: \"%s\"', e,\n                     extra={   # extra data to be logged and indexed by Kibana\n                         'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                         'requester': requester,\n                         'recipient': recipient,\n                         'user': str(request.user),\n                         'environment': env_type,\n                     })\n        logger.debug(\"headers=%r\", r.result.headers,\n                     extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                            'requester': requester,\n                            'recipient': recipient,\n                            'user': str(request.user),\n                            'environment': env_type,\n                            })\n        return False\n    logger.info('Sending MSG success.',\n                extra={  # the same extra data to be logged/indexed\n                    'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                    'requester': requester,\n                    'recipient': recipient,\n                    'user': str(request.user),\n                    'environment': env_type,\n                })\n    return True\n\n\nMy solution — LogExtraCtx:\nIn order to use it, just replace logging.getLogger with getLogger from logextractx.logger,\nand then create local logger with local context:\n\nfrom logextractx.logger import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n[...]\nloclogger = logger.local(extra={'DATA_IN': 'CURRENT_CONTEXT'})\n\n\nso the previous example is reduced to the following clean code:\n\nfrom logextractx.logger import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n\ndef send_message(environment: str, requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Function send_message sends MSG to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"\n\n    # extra data to be logged/indexed\n    loclogger = logger.local(extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                                    'requester': requester,\n                                    'recipient': recipient,\n                                    'user': str(request.user),\n                                    'environment': env_type})\n\n    try:\n        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},\n                          ... < other params > ....)\n        r.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        loclogger.error('Sending MSG failed. Response text: \"%s\"', e)\n        loclogger.debug(\"headers=%r\", r.result.headers)\n        return False\n    loclogger.info('Sending MSG success.')\n    return True\n\n\nInteresting and useful “side effect”\nUsually, it’s hard to distinguish log entries from various users. For example when you have an error in\nyour code and you find IndexError, you cannot be really sure to which request it belongs.\nOf course, you can guess, based on chronology and many other symptoms,\nbut if you have many concurrent requests, then it’s hard or even impossible to associate ERROR log\nwith previous INFO or DEBUG.\nSo it’s nice to have some kind of tracking ID (request-id), that sticks to the request,\nfollows it and is added to every log entry until the end of request processing. It’s also worth having\nsession-id attached to all requests that belong to given HTTP session.\nTo use it in your Django project, you should use the following:\nappend logextractx.middleware.LogCtxDjangoMiddleware to your MIDDLEWARE in settings:\n\n\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n    [...]\n     'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',\n    [...]\n    'logextractx.middleware.LogCtxDjangoMiddleware',\n ]\n\n\nAnd instead of logextractx.logger use logextractx.middleware:\n\n\nfrom logextractx.middleware import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n[...]\n\n\nAlso, you need to add filter into logging\n\n\n    'filters': {\n        'RidFilter': {\n            '()': 'logextractx.middleware.RidFilter'\n        }\n    }\n\n\nAnd that’s all. Now every log entry will contain request-id and session-id fields,\nwhat looks so nice in Kibana:\n\nExtra Formatter\nIf you use plain logging format, instead of Kibana + JSON formatter, then you may be interested in using\nlogextractx.formatter.ExtraFormatter. Just add following in your formatter definition (DictConfig):\n\n\n        'formatters': {\n            'simple': {\n                '()': 'logextractx.formatter.ExtraFormatter',\n                'fmt': '%(levelname)s %(asctime)s %(name)s: %(message)s [%(extras)s]'\n            }\n        }\n\n\nAnd then you will have all extra in a single log line.\nConclusion\nLogging a lot of details is good, but when it leads to breaching the DRY approach, I encourage you\nto use LogExtraCtx.\nAlso feel free to contribute — PRs are welcome.","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/python-logging.html","categories":["tech","python","logging"],"isoDate":"2021-06-16T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/python.png"}],"jobs":[{"id":"743999765435878","name":"Product Manager (Allegro Lokalnie)","uuid":"1064cc30-ffea-4813-8e8c-20ff98db966b","refNumber":"REF2428W","company":{"identifier":"Allegro","name":"Allegro"},"releasedDate":"2021-08-06T09:48:41.000Z","location":{"city":"Poznań, Warszawa, Kraków, Toruń","country":"pl","remote":false},"industry":{"id":"internet","label":"Internet"},"department":{"id":"2572889","label":"IT -
