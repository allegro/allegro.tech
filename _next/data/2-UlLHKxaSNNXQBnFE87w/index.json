Usually, users are faced with a message and an option to retry the request. This approach is far better than\nfailing silently and not informing the user, but still can lead to abandoned actions. Maybe we can do better than that?</p>\n\n<p>What if instead of asking the user to retry the failed request, we could do it automatically? There is another follow-up question: is every request worth\nretrying? Imagine a server responding with status code <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403\">403 (forbidden)</a>,\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/422\">422 (unprocessable entity)</a>, or 4xx in general. These are the client’s faults and usually\nretrying those requests will yield the same result. Now let’s consider 5xx status codes, which are often caused by temporary database unavailability or server\nresource exhaustion. Especially in multi-server environments, chances are that the next request will be rerouted to a healthy instance, resulting in a\nsuccessful response.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in case of increased traffic, repeating failed requests instantly could possibly make things worse. In order to prevent that, it is a good\npractice to introduce an exponential delay between consecutive retry attempts. Another solution, more common in inter-service communication, is a circuit breaker\nmechanism which prevents further requests until service becomes available.</p>\n\n<p>Also, keep in mind that network conditions might not be stable, particularly on mobile devices. If there is no connection, instead of making pointless API\ncalls you could queue the requests and observe\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NavigatorOnLine/Online_and_offline_events\">online/offline events</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, not every request is safe to retry. Sometimes when you receive 5xx, there is no guarantee that it has not been processed. Imagine retrying a request\nto make a money transfer from one account to another - handling it twice would be a disaster! In order to prevent these mistakes from happening, you have to\nmake sure your API is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent\">idempotent</a>. This is usually achieved by using adequate HTTP methods\n(like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT\">PUT</a>) or passing an additional identifier with the request.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"do-not-wait-forever\">Do not wait forever</h3>\n<p>Have you ever wondered how long it takes before an API call times out due to no response from the server?

We were curious whether this tool had\nmore advantages in comparison to traditional Apache Spark. We wanted to find the answer relatively quickly with minimal effort. Hence, we built two projects to\nprocess the same data using these technologies. Below you can get to know the architecture of the jobs written in Apache Spark and Apache Beam.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Given: 4 input tables (~2.5 TB/day).</li>\n  <li>Task: join and clean data.</li>\n  <li>Result: 4 output tables.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-06-28-1-task-2-solutions-spark-or-beam/bigdata-projects-architecture.png\" alt=\"scripting\" /></p>\n\n<p>Note: Below I described our solution and used tools and technologies which do not pretend to be 100% the right approach so your results might be different.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"programming-model\">Programming model</h3>\n\n<p>The first comparison is about showing the way these technologies are built as capturing the general concept plays the first role in writing the code for data\nprocessing.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Based on the in-memory <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce\">MapReduce</a> model evolved from Hadoop MapReduce. This fact forces developers\n        to take care more of executors' memory, as mapping operations occur there. And you still need to remember about shuffling at the Join moment and how to\n        split data to make right repartitioning (too big data chunk causes overloading on machines, too small means more shuffling over the net). How did we tune\n        this job? The only way we knew how to do it was applying some \"a-la best practices\" Spark configurations, running the job with production data volume\n        (just imagine how it reflects machine resource cost!), looking at the metrics and crossing fingers that executors will stand. Finally after n-th attempt\n        it started working.\n        </td>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        It pretends to be a unified processing model. What does it mean? Apache Beam is based on so-called abstract pipelines that can be run on different\n        executors (you can even switch to the Spark execution environment). In our case we're using a DataFlow runner. This pipeline includes every stage of\n        processing starting from data fetching, transformation, ending with the result output. With these pipelines Apache Beam hides low-level things like\n        shuffling, repartitioning, etc. from the developer. Additionally we used <a href=\"https://github.com/allegro/bigflow\">BigFlow</a> open-source framework\n        developed internally in Allegro which is built to support Apache Beam data processing technology (simplifies building packages, configuration and\n        deployment processes).\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Apache Beam looks more like a framework as it abstracts the complexity of processing and hides technical details, and Spark is the\ntechnology where you literally need to dive deeper.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"programming-languages-and-build-tools\">Programming languages and build tools</h3>\n\n<p>Here I do not want to spread hate and discuss which programming language is the best one for data processing, it is the matter of taste. I just would like to\nprovide some context of our team’s background to give you better understanding of our preferences: most of us are specialised in the software development in\nKotlin so we were a little bit biased against non JVM-based languages before starting this task.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        For the main processing part we chose Scala as it looks similar to our background in Java, although there is PySpark - version in Python. Python was\n        used only for composing a DAG file, which is basically a description of steps to be performed by <a href=\"https://airflow.apache.org/\">Airflow</a>\n        (the tool which automates running the job in the cluster).\n        </td>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Natively available in Java and Python, but since we took advantage of the BigFlow framework, Python was used for everything.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Because of Scala, <a href=\"https://www.scala-sbt.org\">sbt</a> is used for building the package and running the tests. This can be more beneficial for\n        Java developers who are familiar with Gradle: it uses the build.sbt configuration file, which like build.gradle declares dependencies, the Scala version\n        to use, etc.\n        </td>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        <a href=\"https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#setuptools\">Setuptools</a> (tool for building Python packages) is run by script.py build script\n        provided by BigFlow. This framework also provides an additional mechanism for managing dependencies which is based on the standard\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools\">pip-tool</a>. Additionally running tests with BigFlow CLI is more convenient and faster compared with sbt.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Scala is much closer to our team (mostly Java developers), especially at the beginning when we needed to get used to working with Python\nwithout static typing. Also Scala is more natural for Spark, so all upcoming features will be firstly supported for this programming language, educational\nresources and examples in Scala for Spark are more exhaustive.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"batch-and-stream-data-processing\">Batch and stream data processing</h3>\n\n<p>In our projects we did not implement stream data processing, since we have batch processing only, but anyway it is probable that business requirements could\nchange so we must also consider how to do it in a better way.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Two different APIs for batch/stream data processing. You need to split data yourself by grouping by the time and it is not truly real-time processing,\n        as basically Spark divides the data stream into micro batches of X seconds called Dstreams, which is a sequence of RDDs under the hood.\n        </td>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Due to the unified model, processing is carried out in the same way for both batch and stream data.

We were curious whether this tool had\nmore advantages in comparison to traditional Apache Spark. We wanted to find the answer relatively quickly with minimal effort. Hence, we built two projects to\nprocess the same data using these technologies. Below you can get to know the architecture of the jobs written in Apache Spark and Apache Beam.\nGiven: 4 input tables (~2.5 TB/day).\nTask: join and clean data.\nResult: 4 output tables.\n\nNote: Below I described our solution and used tools and technologies which do not pretend to be 100% the right approach so your results might be different.\nProgramming model\nThe first comparison is about showing the way these technologies are built as capturing the general concept plays the first role in writing the code for data\nprocessing.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nMapReduce model evolved from Hadoop MapReduce. This fact forces developers\n        to take care more of executors' memory, as mapping operations occur there. And you still need to remember about shuffling at the Join moment and how to\n        split data to make right repartitioning (too big data chunk causes overloading on machines, too small means more shuffling over the net). How did we tune\n        this job? The only way we knew how to do it was applying some \"a-la best practices\" Spark configurations, running the job with production data volume\n        (just imagine how it reflects machine resource cost!), looking at the metrics and crossing fingers that executors will stand. Finally after n-th attempt\n        it started working.\n        \n        \n        It pretends to be a unified processing model. What does it mean? Apache Beam is based on so-called abstract pipelines that can be run on different\n        executors (you can even switch to the Spark execution environment). In our case we're using a DataFlow runner. This pipeline includes every stage of\n        processing starting from data fetching, transformation, ending with the result output. With these pipelines Apache Beam hides low-level things like\n        shuffling, repartitioning, etc. from the developer. Additionally we used BigFlow open-source framework\n        developed internally in Allegro which is built to support Apache Beam data processing technology (simplifies building packages, configuration and\n        deployment processes).\n        \n    \nSummary: Apache Beam looks more like a framework as it abstracts the complexity of processing and hides technical details, and Spark is the\ntechnology where you literally need to dive deeper.\nProgramming languages and build tools\nHere I do not want to spread hate and discuss which programming language is the best one for data processing, it is the matter of taste. I just would like to\nprovide some context of our team’s background to give you better understanding of our preferences: most of us are specialised in the software development in\nKotlin so we were a little bit biased against non JVM-based languages before starting this task.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nAirflow\n        (the tool which automates running the job in the cluster).\n        \n        \n        Natively available in Java and Python, but since we took advantage of the BigFlow framework, Python was used for everything.\n        \n    \nsbt is used for building the package and running the tests. This can be more beneficial for\n        Java developers who are familiar with Gradle: it uses the build.sbt configuration file, which like build.gradle declares dependencies, the Scala version\n        to use, etc.\n        \n        \n        Setuptools (tool for building Python packages) is run by script.py build script\n        provided by BigFlow. This framework also provides an additional mechanism for managing dependencies which is based on the standard\n        pip-tool. Additionally running tests with BigFlow CLI is more convenient and faster compared with sbt.\n        \n    \nSummary: Scala is much closer to our team (mostly Java developers), especially at the beginning when we needed to get used to working with Python\nwithout static typing. Also Scala is more natural for Spark, so all upcoming features will be firstly supported for this programming language, educational\nresources and examples in Scala for Spark are more exhaustive.\nBatch and stream data processing\nIn our projects we did not implement stream data processing, since we have batch processing only, but anyway it is probable that business requirements could\nchange so we must also consider how to do it in a better way.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nSummary: although we didn’t try it ourselves, we’d bet on Apache Beam in this comparison. It looks more adapted for Streaming than Spark.\nAlthough there is a streaming extension since Spark 2.2 but libraries of streaming functions are quite limited. For us this means more efforts to apply.\nTesting\nAlong with the development process these projects were getting more complicated - so we realized the unit testing is not enough to make us feel safe. So below\nare our researches how to ensure the jobs will be able to handle big load in a production environment.\n\n        Apache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nUnit tests (local environment without access to real infrastructure, validation of business logic)\n        \n        Embedded Spark\n        \n        \n        TestPipeline\n        \n    \nIntegration tests (validation of proper reads/writes from/to BigQuery)\n        No official support for mocking BigQuery/Google Storage or embedded/test container version\n    \nE2E tests (ensure job is executed, run in Cloud and has integration with GCP infrastructure)\n        \n        Due to the missing implementation of testing the whole flow, we were running locally jobs to load production data, process them and store into BigQuery\n        tables for development purposes.

Even if it’s possible, it usually leads to inelegant code.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you want to log that some error occured:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'Foo happened: %s'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then so far it’s clean and easy.</p>\n\n<p>It would be nice to add some extra details though, like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">user</code>\n(then you could search by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">user</code> in <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/kibana\">Kibana</a>, if your logs goes there):</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'Foo happened: %s'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">extra</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'user'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">user</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                                           <span class=\"s\">'action_type'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'bar'</span><span class=\"p\">})</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Next, during debugging of a problem, you will notice that it’s not nearly enough and it’s worth\nadding some <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">logging.debug</code></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">debug</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"We're going to do SOMETHING in thread\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n             <span class=\"n\">extra</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'user'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">user</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                    <span class=\"s\">'action_type'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'bar'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                    <span class=\"s\">'thread_num'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">thread_num</span><span class=\"p\">})</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>After that you will notice that your code has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">extra=</code> with duplicated <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">user</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">action_type</code>.\nIt’s a Bad Thing! Imagine what would happen if there was another <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">logger.debug</code>, and another?\nLots of repeated code that should be written only once…</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/54peqd.jpg\" alt=\"I see copypastes in code\" /></p>\n\n<p>So in other words, the more details you log, the more cumbersome the code. What can we\ndo?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"method-1-dont-log-extra\">Method 1: don’t log <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">extra</code></h3>\n\n<p>It’s not what I like.

I like to log as much extra data as possible, and I’m\nfond of logging.debug entries.\nI’m also a DRY approach believer. I feel strong anxiety when I see repetition in code.\nAnd my mind literally hangs when I need to do Ctrl-C/V, even if it’s justified by\ncircumstances. In such cases I start to focus on getting rid of copy-pastes instead of\nwriting new code.\nCombining all these “passions” is not always easy. It’s hard to log everything without\nrepeating things. Even if it’s possible, it usually leads to inelegant code.\nFor example, if you want to log that some error occured:\n\nlogger.error('Foo happened: %s', e)\n\n\nThen so far it’s clean and easy.\nIt would be nice to add some extra details though, like user\n(then you could search by user in Kibana, if your logs goes there):\n\nlogger.error('Foo happened: %s', e, extra={'user': user,\n                                           'action_type': 'bar'})\n\n\nNext, during debugging of a problem, you will notice that it’s not nearly enough and it’s worth\nadding some logging.debug\n\nlogger.debug(\"We're going to do SOMETHING in thread\",\n             extra={'user': user,\n                    'action_type': 'bar',\n                    'thread_num': thread_num})\n\n\nAfter that you will notice that your code has extra= with duplicated user and action_type.\nIt’s a Bad Thing! Imagine what would happen if there was another logger.debug, and another?\nLots of repeated code that should be written only once…\n\nSo in other words, the more details you log, the more cumbersome the code. What can we\ndo?\nMethod 1: don’t log extra\nIt’s not what I like. I do want to log them!\nMethod 2: store extra in a variable\nIt’s what I used to do sometimes, before LogExtraCtx. It could go like that:\n\nextra = {'user': user, 'action_type': 'bar'}\n\nlogger.debug(\"We're going to do SOMETHING in thread\",\n             extra=dict(thread_num=thread_num, **extra))\n\nlogger.error('Foo happened: %s', e, extra=extra)\n\n\nQuite tricky and not very elegant.\nMethod 3: use LogExtraCtx\nBefore I describe the aforementioned library, let me show you a more realistic example.\nConsider the following code:\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n\ndef send_message(requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Function send_message sends message to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"\n    try:\n        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},\n                          ... < other params > ....)\n        r.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error('Sending message failed. Response text: \"%s\"', e,\n                     extra={  # extra data to be logged and indexed by Kibana\n                         'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                         'requester': requester,\n                         'recipient': recipient,\n                     })\n        return False\n    logger.info('Sending MSG success.',\n                extra={  # the same extra data to be logged/indexed\n                    'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                    'requester': requester,\n                    'recipient': recipient,\n                })\n    return True\n\n\nThere are two log entries, both with extra data for easy-finding in Kibana (there is a bit\nof redundancy in the code, so I already feel the desire to DRY it).\nThen I need to add additional logging:\n\nlogger.debug(\"headers=%r\", r.result.headers,\n             extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                    'requester': requester,\n                    'recipient': recipient\n                    })\n\n\nAnd then, I need even more context in every log entry:\n\nextra = {'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n         'requester': requester,\n         'recipient': recipient,\n         'user': str(request.user),\n         'environment': env_type,\n         }\n\n\nCombined all together, it becomes a big, unreadable blob of code. A very simple piece of logic has been\nspoiled by 3 log entries.\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n\ndef send_message(environment: str, requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Function send_message sends MSG to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"\n    try:\n        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},\n                          ... < other params > ....)\n        r.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error('Sending MSG failed. Response text: \"%s\"', e,\n                     extra={   # extra data to be logged and indexed by Kibana\n                         'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                         'requester': requester,\n                         'recipient': recipient,\n                         'user': str(request.user),\n                         'environment': env_type,\n                     })\n        logger.debug(\"headers=%r\", r.result.headers,\n                     extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                            'requester': requester,\n                            'recipient': recipient,\n                            'user': str(request.user),\n                            'environment': env_type,\n                            })\n        return False\n    logger.info('Sending MSG success.',\n                extra={  # the same extra data to be logged/indexed\n                    'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                    'requester': requester,\n                    'recipient': recipient,\n                    'user': str(request.user),\n                    'environment': env_type,\n                })\n    return True\n\n\nMy solution — LogExtraCtx:\nIn order to use it, just replace logging.getLogger with getLogger from logextractx.logger,\nand then create local logger with local context:\n\nfrom logextractx.logger import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n[...]\nloclogger = logger.local(extra={'DATA_IN': 'CURRENT_CONTEXT'})\n\n\nso the previous example is reduced to the following clean code:\n\nfrom logextractx.logger import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n\ndef send_message(environment: str, requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Function send_message sends MSG to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"\n\n    # extra data to be logged/indexed\n    loclogger = logger.local(extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                                    'requester': requester,\n                                    'recipient': recipient,\n                                    'user': str(request.user),\n                                    'environment': env_type})\n\n    try:\n        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},\n                          ... < other params > ....)\n        r.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        loclogger.error('Sending MSG failed. Response text: \"%s\"', e)\n        loclogger.debug(\"headers=%r\", r.result.headers)\n        return False\n    loclogger.info('Sending MSG success.')\n    return True\n\n\nInteresting and useful “side effect”\nUsually, it’s hard to distinguish log entries from various users. For example when you have an error in\nyour code and you find IndexError, you cannot be really sure to which request it belongs.\nOf course, you can guess, based on chronology and many other symptoms,\nbut if you have many concurrent requests, then it’s hard or even impossible to associate ERROR log\nwith previous INFO or DEBUG.\nSo it’s nice to have some kind of tracking ID (request-id), that sticks to the request,\nfollows it and is added to every log entry until the end of request processing. It’s also worth having\nsession-id attached to all requests that belong to given HTTP session.\nTo use it in your Django project, you should use the following:\nappend logextractx.middleware.LogCtxDjangoMiddleware to your MIDDLEWARE in settings:\n\n\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n    [...]\n     'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',\n    [...]\n    'logextractx.middleware.LogCtxDjangoMiddleware',\n ]\n\n\nAnd instead of logextractx.logger use logextractx.middleware:\n\n\nfrom logextractx.middleware import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n[...]\n\n\nAlso, you need to add filter into logging\n\n\n    'filters': {\n        'RidFilter': {\n            '()': 'logextractx.middleware.RidFilter'\n        }\n    }\n\n\nAnd that’s all. Now every log entry will contain request-id and session-id fields,\nwhat looks so nice in Kibana:\n\nExtra Formatter\nIf you use plain logging format, instead of Kibana + JSON formatter, then you may be interested in using\nlogextractx.formatter.ExtraFormatter. Just add following in your formatter definition (DictConfig):\n\n\n        'formatters': {\n            'simple': {\n                '()': 'logextractx.formatter.ExtraFormatter',\n                'fmt': '%(levelname)s %(asctime)s %(name)s: %(message)s [%(extras)s]'\n            }\n        }\n\n\nAnd then you will have all extra in a single log line.\nConclusion\nLogging a lot of details is good, but when it leads to breaching the DRY approach, I encourage you\nto use LogExtraCtx.\nAlso feel free to contribute — PRs are welcome.","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/python-logging.html","categories":["tech","python","logging"],"isoDate":"2021-06-16T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/python.png"},{"title":"Measuring Web Performance","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/measuring-web-performance.html","pubDate":"Tue, 08 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0200","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Jerzy Jelinek"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/jerzy.jelinek.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/jerzy.jelinek"]}]},"content":"<p>Some time ago we announced that Allegro passes Core Web Vitals assessment and thanks to that we were awarded in “<a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-cee/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/why-should-73-of-polish-websites-have-a-closer-look-at-their-mobile-user-experience/\" title=\"Core Web Vitals Hall of Fame\">Core Web Vitals Hall of Fame</a>”.\nIt means that Allegro is in the group of the 27% fastest websites in Polish Internet.</p>\n\n<p>In this series of articles, Webperf team and I want to tell you what our daily work has been like over the years,\nwhat we’ve optimized and what we’ve failed at, and how the perception of web performance has changed at our company.</p>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 10px auto; display: flex; max-width: 550px;\"><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 544px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=allegrotech&amp;dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3R3ZWV0X2VtYmVkX2NsaWNrYWJpbGl0eV8xMjEwMiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJjb250cm9sIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH19&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1331547521139822592&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.allegro.tech%2F2021%2F06%2Fmeasuring-web-performance.html&amp;sessionId=1ab4cf28b64fcefdb722376a0651b436e188c01b&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=82e1070%3A1619632193066&amp;width=550px\" data-tweet-id=\"1331547521139822592\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Our path to a quite fast page (we’re still hoping for more) was winding, bumpy, more than once ended in a dead end and forced us to rethink our solutions.\nWe want to show that there is no magical <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">{ perf: true }</code> option and that some things you just have to figure out by trial and error.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"beginnings\">Beginnings</h2>\n\n<p>It all started with a group of enthusiasts concerned about the poor performance of <a href=\"https://allegro.pl\" title=\"Allegro.pl\">Allegro</a> and the lack of actions to improve it.\nTheir grassroots initiative was appreciated and the core of the technical team (Webperf) was formed.\nThere was one major problem — it is relatively easy to make micro-optimizations in the code of one component,\nhowever, it is much more difficult to push through a major change involving different teams or business areas.\nThe company needed to know how the change would affect not only performance but also the business.\nAt that time there were many success stories from various companies on the internet about how improvements in loading speed had impacted their business results.\nHowever, at Allegro, we had never seen correlation between performance and business. It was our holy grail to be found and as a first step,\nthe decision was made to collect performance measures that could be linked to business data in the future.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"measurement\">Measurement</h2>\n\n<p>The idea was simple, we wanted to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>create a library which would use Performance API to create marks on the client side,</li>\n  <li>use an existing mechanism for sending events to the backend,</li>\n  <li>store the information in a database so we could easily operate on it,</li>\n  <li>and finally display basic metrics on a dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But first things first.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"metrics-library\">Metrics Library</h3>\n\n<p>The first commits to the library collecting performance measures (called Pinter) took place on June 5, 2017.

It was our holy grail to be found and as a first step,\nthe decision was made to collect performance measures that could be linked to business data in the future.\nMeasurement\nThe idea was simple, we wanted to:\ncreate a library which would use Performance API to create marks on the client side,\nuse an existing mechanism for sending events to the backend,\nstore the information in a database so we could easily operate on it,\nand finally display basic metrics on a dashboard.\nBut first things first.\nMetrics Library\nThe first commits to the library collecting performance measures (called Pinter) took place on June 5, 2017. Since then, it has been actively developed.\nWe collect two types of measures in Pinter:\nStandard, e.g., Web Vitals,\nCustom, e.g., Time To Component Interactive.\nPrinciple of operation of the Pinter\n\nIn general, metrics’ changes are tracked using PerformanceObserver from which values are collected, processed into a performance event and sent to the backend.\nHowever, there are several metrics, e.g., Navigation Timing, Resource Timing or Benchmark that are only sent once, after the document has loaded.\nOur script, like any other, can affect web performance. This is why the traffic is sampled and the library itself is not served to all users.\nCollected measures\nThe browser provides a whole bunch of APIs to analyze resources, connections etc. Combined with data from the DOM tree, we have a general picture of what the user experience was like.\nBelow is a slice of what we are collecting and why:\nWeb Vitals\n    \nFirst Contentful Paint — when the first content on the page was rendered.\nLargest Contentful Paint — what is the largest image or text block on the page and when it appeared on the screen.\nCumulative Layout Shift — layout stability.\nFirst Input Delay — how quickly the first user interaction is handled.\nCustom Marks\n    \nTime To Component Interactive — when the critical component is fully interactive and can handle all user actions, e.g. after React rehydration.\nNavigation\n    \nType — what type of navigation the user was using. Useful when analyzing metrics.\nTiming — data from window.performance.timing about connection, response time, load time etc.\nResources\n    \nTransfer Size — the total size of scripts and styles transferred over the network.\nTotal Encoded Body Size — the total size of scripts and styles on the page. Is not distorted by cache.\nResource count — number of assets with breakdown into styles, internal scripts and 3rd party scripts.\nBenchmark — information about the performance of a given device. We want to know if weaker devices perform worse and if our fixes have a positive impact on them.\nThe backend\nAll collected performance data is sent to the backend where it is anonymized, aggregated and prepared to be displayed on charts.\nIt is a complex system which allows us to operate only on the necessary portion of data.\nPrinciple of operation of the backend\n\nInitially, all events (including performance ones) are gathered and stored in a single HIVE table.\nWe want to be able to quickly analyze as well as compare historical records, but this amount of data would effectively prevent us from doing so.\nTherefore, we need a whole process to extract the most relevant information.
