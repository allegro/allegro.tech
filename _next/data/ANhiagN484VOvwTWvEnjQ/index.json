He was just trying to match what he already knew from onboarding days with what was just\nsaid. It was really difficult to follow team discussion at the same time. It was a standard planning session, held over\nZoom, with his distributed team. Someone was already sharing their screen and the story summary, along with acceptance\ncriteria, was visible. They were developing an online store and the current topic was: basket price reduction for active\nusers. In short: users who spent more than 50€ for the last 7 days should have a discount applied during the checkout\nprocess.</p>\n\n<p>— Well, we are going to add a new service which is going to hold this discount logic. We will provide an API for the\ncart service to call us and we will check the transactions store for recent orders.<br />\n— Is that all?<br />\n— I didn’t catch more changes.<br />\n— What about customers willing to check if they are eligible for a discount?<br />\n— Oh, so it seems we need to change the “My Account” page as well.<br />\n— And the checkout service? We have to both display discount and use it.<br />\n— You’re right! I was trying to picture the main change in my mind and wasn’t paying attention to the whole\ndiscussion.<br />\n— Guys, checkout stays the same. The cart is providing everything the checkout requires.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"retrospective\">Retrospective</h3>\n\n<p>Let’s stop here for a moment. Have you ever been in a situation, when you were forced to do two things at the same time?\nFor example, listening to what is being said and trying to actively participate in the discussion regarding a not exactly\nwell-known topic? Was it a demanding experience? I had such an opportunity and I remember these sessions as quite\ndemanding. Usually, after an hourly session, I was exhausted and in need of a break. Not to mention that it required a\nsignificant amount of writing to capture everything that was said — just to have an option of referring back to this\nduring the sprint. What if this session looked differently?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"visual-planning\">Visual planning</h3>\n\n<p>— Josh, could you summarize what we are going to implement, please?</p>\n\n<p>That was a bit unexpected, however, it was a no-brainer.\n<img src=\"/img/articles/2022-03-30-visual-thinking/planning_services.png\" alt=\"planning services\" />\n“As we can see in the picture we are going to add a new service, discounts. This service will be called by the current\ncart service to display a reduced price (if applicable). Also, the “My Account” page is going to call us to retrieve the\ncurrent rebate for the logged user”.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-difference\">The difference</h3>\n\n<p>What is the main difference between the first scenario and the second one? To me, it is about a common model. In the first\ncase, I am building an individual model of a change. I need a significant amount of energy to translate speech to my model\nand to explain my model to others. What is more — everyone involved in the discussion is building a mental model on\ntheir own with a similar amount of energy spent on synchronization.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2022-03-30-visual-thinking/private_models.png\" alt=\"private models\" /></p>\n\n<p>In the case of the second scenario, the model is shared. There is no need to maintain private models. It is easy to\nunderstand changed elements and to refer to discussed changes later. “A picture is worth a thousand words” after all.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2022-03-30-visual-thinking/common_model.png\" alt=\"common model\" /></p>\n\n<p>Output from a visual planning is something that can be used further during a sprint. Depending on the tool it is\npossible to use it instead of an issue-tracking tool. Sticky notes can indicate actions, tasks, TODOs. They can be\narranged in a tree and display the scope of a pull request. They can be connected by a dotted line to indicate dependencies.\nAnd in the worst case, when you do not have any idea how to visualize something, you can always use a block of text and\ndescribe it using words.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2022-03-30-visual-thinking/planning_tasks.png\" alt=\"planning tasks\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-background\">The background</h2>\n\n<p>Why switching to a drawing board has such an effect? To answer this question we have to check some facts.</p>\n\n<p>On a daily basis, a spoken (or written) language is our standard way of communication. Children, however, need some time\nto develop such a skill. Earlier they are able to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>register movement (at 2 months of age)</li>\n  <li>try to grab things by hand (5 months)</li>\n  <li>follow movement with their eyes, find hidden things (7 months)</li>\n  <li>exploit cause-effect — drop a toy and watch it fall (8 months)</li>\n  <li>start to use words in a proper context (11 months)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Such spatial skills are something all creatures need to develop to survive. Even plants, to some extent, exhibit\nspatial-aware behavior — they move to follow the sun.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that spatial-related terms\nlike <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_semantic_metalanguage\">“where, here, near, etc.”</a>\ncan be translated to any language in the world.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, what language do we use to express ideas-related actions? As Barbara Tversky listed in her\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmc4wEL2aPQ\">“Mind in motion”</a> lecture we can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>raise ideas</li>\n  <li>pull them together</li>\n  <li>tear apart</li>\n  <li>turn inside out</li>\n  <li>push forward</li>\n  <li>toss out</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2022-03-30-visual-thinking/ideas_and_actions.png\" alt=\"ideas and actions\" /></p>\n\n<p>We talk about ideas in the same way as about any space-related topic!</p>\n\n<p>How could it happen? Scientists have been trying to understand the functions of different parts of the brain for some time\nalready. In the seventies, they have identified the so-called <strong>place cells</strong> — neurons that are activated at a specific\nlocation. It took some time to identify another layer of neurons on top of these: <strong>grid cells</strong>, working as our inner\nGPS, activated when switching locations. The latter discovery was\nawarded a <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2014/press-release/\">Nobel Prize in 2014</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Tests on human beings resulted in another finding: place cells are activated not only in specific locations. They are\nalso activated by events, people, ideas. The grid cells are activated by thinking about the consequences of events, by\nsocial interactions, and by connecting ideas together. We are using the same brain structures for spatial orientation,\nfor ideas, and for social interactions. This is the reason why Barbara Tversky issued an audacious thesis that “all\nthoughts begin as spatial thoughts”.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"map-elements\">Map elements</h3>\n\n<p>Nowadays we have a GPS sensor in almost any smartphone, so it is rather difficult to get lost. Basic GPS information -\ncurrent coordinate — is not very useful by itself. It is much more convenient to display our current location over a map\nlayer. What is a map? According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map\">wikipedia</a>, it is “[..] a symbolic depiction\nemphasizing relationships between elements of some space [..]”.</p>\n\n<p>As our ideas — and imaginary concepts like services — are treated by our brains as spatial elements we simply use known\nconcepts of space visualization to present imagined beings and relations among them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"arrows\">Arrows</h3>\n\n<p>So far we used several symbols in our planning diagrams. Almost all of them can be found in maps as well, except one.\nThis element is an arrow — a significant element of our drawings. According to Barbara Tversky in the already\nmentioned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmc4wEL2aPQ\">“Mind in motion” lecture</a>\narrows as visual elements started to appear in the 20th century. Before that symbols of feet or fingers had been used to\nindicate direction. The addition of arrows changes our perception of diagrams: without them, it is usually a structural\ndrawing, that requires additional labels to understand. Arrows transform such a structural diagram into a functional\ndiagram: we can trace arrows to their origin, we see how things are connected and how they cooperate. Check the\nexample below — the left-hand side version is static, only describes elements and the right-hand side version shows the movement\nof particular elements without using a single word.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2022-03-30-visual-thinking/clock.png\" alt=\"static and dynamic clock\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"messy-lines\">Messy lines</h2>\n\n<p>All these well-known elements are our means of communication with other people, or even ourselves, at a different point\nin time. Sometimes we draw to discover, we sketch shapes to find inspiration, an idea. This seems to be important in\na different creative profession: architecture. Architects discover ideas in sketches. The ambiguity of non-obvious shapes\npromotes creativity. It is so important in this profession that sketches from private collections are sold as books.

I’ll show you how we write automatic UI tests on Android in Allegro Pay.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-introduction\">The Introduction</h2>\n<p>Tests are designed to check whether the user interface is working properly. For example they verify\nif users see an appropriate screen with correct data and don’t encounter an unexpected behavior.\nThese tests, apart from checking the correctness of displayed screen, should also check whether the\nuser sees the appropriate screen after clicking a button. They allow to check the business process\nin a controlled manner. At Allegro Pay, we have several critical processes, such as onboarding a new\ncustomer or repayment of liabilities. Until now, these processes have been tested manually. Automating\nthese tests allows us to save the tester’s time and eliminates possible human errors.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-application-class\">The Application Class</h2>\n<p>You can have your tests running the whole <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.allegro\">application</a>\nor go for partial coverage only. In our case, they run only single module, namely Allegro Pay. This solution\nis associated with certain changes that needed to be made. The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">AllegroPayTestApplication</code> class has been created\ninheriting from the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">TestApplication</code> class. It contains dependencies needed to run our module as a separate\napplication. Apart from this class, you need to prepare a manifest so that it has references to all activities\navailable in our module.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-kotlin highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">AllegroPayTestApplication</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nc\">TestApplication</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n\n   <span class=\"k\">override</span> <span class=\"k\">fun</span> <span class=\"nf\">onCreate</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n       <span class=\"k\">super</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">onCreate</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n       <span class=\"nf\">initKoin</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n   <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n   <span class=\"k\">private</span> <span class=\"k\">fun</span> <span class=\"nf\">initKoin</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n       <span class=\"nf\">loadKoinModules</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n           <span class=\"n\">loadNeededModulesHere</span>\n       <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n   <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-tool-framework-and-pattern\">The Tool, Framework And Pattern</h2>\n<p>Tools and frameworks used in the process of adding tests are Espresso and Wiremock Stubbing\nand the PageObject pattern.\n<img src=\"/img/articles/2022-03-09-android-ui-testing-in-allegro-pay-organization/espresso_and_wiremock.png\" alt=\"Espresso and Wiremock logos\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wiremock\">Wiremock</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wiremock.org/\">Wiremock</a> is a tool which allows mocking the response for\na given endpoint with a declared data example. In addition, it can also record requests, map responses, edit\nresponse data, and act as a transparent proxy. This solution supports testing of edge cases and different response\nstatuses that are difficult or impossible to automatically simulate in a real test environment. Another big\nreason for using this tool is stability. Since the test environment to which these tests need to connect doesn’t\nalways work, running the test would not bring any benefits. This would be wasting resources and generating costs.\nThanks to Wiremock, it is possible to obtain the same answer each time.

And the question posed at the very beginning of this article\nis still open.</p>\n","contentSnippet":"Will automatic UI tests be able to replace manual testers as artificial intelligence will try to replace\nprogrammers? I’ll show you how we write automatic UI tests on Android in Allegro Pay.\nThe Introduction\nTests are designed to check whether the user interface is working properly. For example they verify\nif users see an appropriate screen with correct data and don’t encounter an unexpected behavior.\nThese tests, apart from checking the correctness of displayed screen, should also check whether the\nuser sees the appropriate screen after clicking a button. They allow to check the business process\nin a controlled manner. At Allegro Pay, we have several critical processes, such as onboarding a new\ncustomer or repayment of liabilities. Until now, these processes have been tested manually. Automating\nthese tests allows us to save the tester’s time and eliminates possible human errors.\nThe Application Class\nYou can have your tests running the whole application\nor go for partial coverage only. In our case, they run only single module, namely Allegro Pay. This solution\nis associated with certain changes that needed to be made. The AllegroPayTestApplication class has been created\ninheriting from the TestApplication class. It contains dependencies needed to run our module as a separate\napplication. Apart from this class, you need to prepare a manifest so that it has references to all activities\navailable in our module.\n\nclass AllegroPayTestApplication : TestApplication() {\n\n   override fun onCreate() {\n       super.onCreate()\n       initKoin()\n   }\n\n   private fun initKoin() {\n       loadKoinModules(\n           loadNeededModulesHere\n       )\n   }\n}\n\n\nThe Tool, Framework And Pattern\nTools and frameworks used in the process of adding tests are Espresso and Wiremock Stubbing\nand the PageObject pattern.\n\nWiremock\nWiremock is a tool which allows mocking the response for\na given endpoint with a declared data example. In addition, it can also record requests, map responses, edit\nresponse data, and act as a transparent proxy. This solution supports testing of edge cases and different response\nstatuses that are difficult or impossible to automatically simulate in a real test environment. Another big\nreason for using this tool is stability. Since the test environment to which these tests need to connect doesn’t\nalways work, running the test would not bring any benefits. This would be wasting resources and generating costs.\nThanks to Wiremock, it is possible to obtain the same answer each time. Here is an example stub:\n\nopen class Stub(val mappingBuilder: MappingBuilder)\n\ninternal object GreetingStub : Stub(\n   get(\n       urlEqualTo(\"/allegropay/greeting\")\n   ).willReturn(\n       aResponse()\n           .withStatus(200)\n           .withBody(GREETING_STUB)\n   )\n)\n\n// <editor-fold defaultstate=collapsed desc=\"GreetingStub\">\n\n@Language(\"json\")\nval GREETING_STUB = \"\"\"\n {\n   \"greeting\": \"hello\"\n }\n\"\"\"\n\n// </editor-fold>\n\n\nThe above code shows a stub, that allows any query to /allegropay/greeting to respond with a status\nof 200 and data entered in the GREETING_STUB field.\nEspresso\nAnother tool which I would like to present is Espresso.\nIt allows describing what we want to test in our activity. You can simulate the operation of the application as\nif it was used by the customer. This tool provides several simple methods for ensuring the interaction and\nassertion of the view state. I put a cheat sheet with the most needed and most used matchers, actions,\nassertions, etc. below. Espresso provides management of the main thread, what significantly speeds up and\nfacilitates writing tests. An important consideration when using this tool is that system animations and\n“don’t keep activities” function cannot be enabled on the test device.\n\nPageObject Pattern\nThe last thing needed to write perfect tests is the PageObject pattern\nwhich allows you to store the interactions and assertions in one place in the context of each screen. According to\nMartin Fowler (if you haven’t read his books, you should!):\nThe basic rule of thumb for a page object is that it should allow a software client to do anything and\nsee anything that a human can.\nThe test\nBelow is one of the tests written for the Dashboard screen:\n\n@Test\n@Stubs(\n   Stub1::class,\n   Stub2::class,\n   Stub3::class,\n   Stub4::class,\n   Stub5::class\n)\nfun testUserCanSeeDashboardThenSettingsThenOverpaymentThenGoBackToDashboard() = launchDashboardActivity {\n   inDashboard()\n       .toolbarPage { toolbar ->\n           toolbar.checkName(DASHBOARD_TOOLBAR_NAME_RES_ID)\n               .dashboardMenuItemPage { menuItem ->\n                   menuItem.tapOnOptionsButton()\n               }\n       }\n\n   inSettings()\n       .toolbarPage { toolbar ->\n           toolbar.checkName(SETTINGS_TOOLBAR_NAME_RES_ID)\n       }.overpaymentItemPage(position = 1) { item ->\n           item.tapOnOverpayment()\n       }\n\n   inOverpayment(parseOverpaymentData(OVERPAYMENT_WITHOUT_IBAN_POSITIVE))\n       .toolbarPage { toolbar ->\n           toolbar.checkName(OVERPAYMENT_TOOLBAR_NAME_RES_ID)\n               .tapToolbarBack()\n       }\n\n   inSettings()\n       .toolbarPage { toolbar ->\n           toolbar.checkName(SETTINGS_TOOLBAR_NAME_RES_ID)\n               .tapToolbarBack()\n       }\n\n   inDashboard()\n       .toolbarPage { toolbar ->\n           toolbar.checkName(DASHBOARD_TOOLBAR_NAME_RES_ID)\n       }\n}\n\n\nThe above test allows you to check the path followed by the user who wants to see the overpayment screen\nfrom the dashboard and then return.
