Then, let’s dive into how we can accomplish this.\nImplementation\nSVG and CSS are gifts that keep giving and can do wonders combined.\nThe proposed technique is a combination of two platform capabilities.\nSVG Fragments\nCSS Masks\nSVG Fragments aren’t really a new technology.\nAbout five years ago, we considered using CSS masks, but we still supported IE back then.\nAt that time, we had not yet thought of combining it with fragments.\nAs a case study let’s pick one of our icons —\n.\nWith the following source:\n\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\" fill=\"none\" height=\"32\" width=\"32\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <path d=\"...\" fill=\"#B0B8BC\"></path>\n  <path clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"...\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" fill=\"#FF7B33\"></path>\n  <path d=\"...\" fill=\"#D9DFE4\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n\nThis particular icon consists of 3 parts, each with a different color.\nNow, we’re going to control these colors with the document’s CSS.\nIt’s time to program in SVG and CSS for a moment.\nStep #1 — SVG Fragments\nFirst, let’s craft our test subject and introduce the fragments.\nEach path gets a unique Fragment Identifier by setting an id attribute.\nNext, we add a little CSS to enable rendering fragments in isolation. Think of it as an image sprite.\nFor the sake of CSS simplicity, we also group all the paths under an extra g element with a unique id.\nAs a result, the SVG is supposed to look like this:\n\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\" fill=\"none\" height=\"32\" width=\"32\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <style>\n    path:not(:target) {\n      display: none;\n    }\n    g:target path {\n      display: inline;\n    }\n  </style>\n  <g id=\"icon\">\n    <path id=\"border\" d=\"...\" fill=\"#B0B8BC\"></path>\n    <path id=\"a\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"...\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" fill=\"#FF7B33\"></path>\n    <path id=\"shadow\" d=\"...\" fill=\"#D9DFE4\"></path>\n  </g>\n</svg>\n\n\nIt produces 4 fragments, one for each of the three paths and the last for the whole icon. Each of them can now be rendered as a separate image:\n#a — \n#border — \n#shadow — \n#icon — \nNow, the regular fragment-less URL will display a blank image.\nThus, for the full icon, we’re going to add a #icon fragment to the URL.\nWe won’t use the #a fragment, but let’s keep its identifier.\nStep #2 — CSS Masks\nWith SVG Fragment Identifiers up and ready, we can use CSS Masks.\nThe base class .icon stacks three layers on top of each other, ready for a mask.\n\n.icon {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 32px;\n  height: 32px;\n  mask-repeat: no-repeat;\n  background-color: currentColor;\n}\n.icon::before,\n.icon::after {\n  content: '';\n  position: absolute;\n  width: inherit;\n  height: inherit;\n  background-color: inherit;\n}\n\n\nThe last CSS class is for our specific icon.\n\n.icon--a {\n  mask-image: url('./a.svg#icon'); /* full icon’s shape */\n  color: #FF7B33;\n}\n.icon--a::before {\n  mask-image: url('./a.svg#shadow'); /* shadow’s shape */\n  color: #D9DFE4;\n}\n.icon--a::after {\n  mask-image: url('./a.svg#border'); /* border’s shape */\n  color: #B0B8BC;\n}\n\n\nThe critical part is that we picked the whole icon, not any fragment, as the parent’s mask, so we have the entire icon visible.\nThat’s because the parent layer masks its children.\nWe selected the orange color of the a for the parent layer.\nThen, we put the two remaining layers on top of it.\nThe second and third layers are for shadow and border parts, respectively.\nWe can describe this as the whole icon in single color covered by one or more shapes in different colors.\nWhen an icon has intersecting parts, there’s one thing to keep in mind.\nBackgrounds render on top of each other in a particular order:\nthe parent’s background,\nthe ::before pseudo-element’s background,\nthe ::after’s background at the end.\nAs a result, we can embed the icon by a single element.\n\n<div class=\"icon icon--a\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div>\n\n\nLet’s also consider accessibility.\nUsually, icons are purely decorative content.\nThat’s why we remove them from the accessibility tree by aria-hidden=\"true\".\nThe result is supposed to look like the original icon from the start —\n.\nNow, the single element gives us control over up to three parts of our icon.\nMoreover, we can change colors independently and dynamically.\nThe demo\nFeel free to check the demo.\nPretty neat.\nWe found this technique practical, and we’re keen to use it in the future.\nMore colors\nIf you need more than 3 colors, switch from pseudo-elements to regular elements.

If, despite all discouragement, you are interested in solving technical mysteries,\ntake a sip of coffee and enjoy the story!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"clever-what-have-we-built\">Clever: what have we built?</h2>\n\n<p>A few years ago, we researched several platforms that can be used as <em>transparent HTTP proxies</em> capable of handling HTTP traffic to our services.\nWe needed a solution that would be able to inspect metadata and user data against any suspicious patterns and decide if such traffic should be processed or banned.\nWe chose <a href=\"https://nginx.org/en/docs/\">nginx</a> in concert with <a href=\"https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity\">ModSecurity</a> as a foundation for a more complex\necosystem.</p>\n\n<p>During increasing usage of such a stack, more than simple non-contextual rules was needed for more complex traffic analysis. One of the most crucial needs was providing the ability to store some contextual information connected\nwith session activity in order to better recognize malicious patterns.\nBy default, <em>ModSecurity</em> allows storing contextual information in memory. Such an approach is not very useful in connection with HTTP servers that utilize\nmultiprocessing as <em>nginx</em> does.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/nginx-in-memory.png\" alt=\"In-memory approach\" /></p>\n\n<p>However, we learned that <em>ModSecurity</em> can use <a href=\"http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/\">LMDB</a> as an internal fast storage for contextual information that could be\nshared between requests that come, for example, from the same IP address. <em>LMDB</em> approach ensures that contextual information stored by one nginx worker process\nis accessible by others.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/nginx-with-lmdb.png\" alt=\"LMDB approach\" /></p>\n\n<p>At first glance, it looks great; however, in our case, we could not rely on information that is stored directly by <em>ModSecurity</em>.\nAs you can imagine, our setup is based on more than one server, so we have to be able to pass the same contextual information to each of them.\nMoreover, our algorithms that compute such information are complex and reach for more data than those available to ModSecurity.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, <em>LMDB</em> has one great advantage: it allows connecting to it from outside the <em>nginx</em> process and altering the contextual data that is available to\n<em>ModSecurity</em>.\nWe built a mechanism that syncs contextual information from dedicated service to LMDB on each transparent proxy host.\nA simplified view of the architecture that allows computing and synchronizing contextual information is depicted below (dotted lines represent asynchronous flow):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/nginx-architecture.png\" alt=\"Final architecture\" /></p>\n\n<p>Such a PoC gave us promising results regarding how fast the contextual information could be provided and how fast it was retrieved by <em>ModSecurity</em>.\nFinally, we rolled out the new approach, and everything worked smoothly for such a long time that we assumed it was a rock-solid solution.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"surprised-once-upon-a-time-the-problem-occurred-for-the-first-time\">Surprised: once upon a time, the problem occurred for the first time</h2>\n\n<p>We noticed that response time from the client’s perspective soared, and the number of established connections also increased.\nSuch a correlation is not strange and was noticed many times in the past when the upstream that handles requests from proxy started responding slower.\nWhat was mysterious in that case was that there was no evidence of a problem on the upstream side besides the metric from <em>nginx</em> that was based on\n<em>$upstream_connect_time</em>.\nAccording to that metric, connecting to the upstream had slowed down significantly.</p>\n\n<p>Having such <em>a clue</em> we blamed the part of infrastructure that is always to blame if no one knows what is happening.\nAs you probably guessed, we assumed that was a temporary network issue (from my experience, it is the best justification to not dig more profound).\nUnfortunately, <em>the network issue</em> started occurring quite often, at least a few times a week.\nStrangely enough, if we disable the transparent proxy, the network seems to be stable. Once again, we were convinced that someone from the network team devised blameless culture.\nHence, we started to verify a lot of new hypotheses, from those scary (cyber war, specialized attacks that are hidden in regular traffic) to those that bring\nsmiles upon our faces at least for today (backdoor left by <em>Russian spy</em> in the nginx source code).\nFalsification of those hypotheses that were at least partially backed up by data is a great story about how to teach engineers that correlation does not mean\ncausation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"turn-gray-investigation\">Turn gray: investigation</h2>\n\n<p>Let me introduce a simplified view of our infrastructure to show where we gathered data.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/proxy-chain.png\" alt=\"Proxy chain\" /></p>\n\n<p>All proxies measure at least the total processing time, including the time consumed in the proxy and the time that was consumed outside the proxy (passing the\nrequest to the next server in the above chain and waiting for the response).\nAnd those parts could be analyzed independently. Based on such measurements, we can simply compute the approximate overhead of the proxy as a difference between the whole\nrequest (green box) processing and the upstream (red box) waiting.\nHaving that, we were able to discover that the time consumed in transparent proxy was not increased significantly; only the time consumed outside of proxy was\nraised (red box).\nIt was one of the big lies that hindered revealing the truth. You can find a broader explanation of misleading metrics in the lessons learned part.\nAfter excluding network issues, and upstream issues, we were pretty sure that the problem lay in transparent proxy, and we started to doubt what we saw in\nmetrics.\nIt took a while, but finally, we were able to break our unwavering trust in data. Relying on data is encoded in our company DNA, so trusting it was a natural\ninstinct, unfortunately, a bad one in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Having that, we could not rely on metrics provided by a transparent proxy. We were starting to try out other means to measure what was going on inside the\ntransparent proxy.\nBeing biased by network issues, we started gathering a lot of network-related information that only showed correlations with problems, but it did not give any\nclues about what was happening.</p>\n\n<p>It was a time to use the more straightforward but quite heavy solution - access logs. However, logs are not very useful in giving the overall condition of the proxy;\nthey can be beneficial in analyzing singular problems.\nWhen the problems occurred again, we had some data that we could scrutinize. It turned out that an excellent idea was to log exact timestamps in\na very high resolution (which was not default).\nBelow, you can see a real example reproduced in the local environment (which will be described later).\nEach line contains nginx worker process id, timestamp, request_time, upstream_request_time, upstream_connect_time and the response status code.</p>\n<pre>\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:<b>8.990</b> urt:<b>8.990</b> uct:<b>7.128</b> status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:12.348 urt:12.348 uct:3.358 status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:<b>8.990</b> urt:<b>8.990</b> uct:<b>7.128</b> status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:<b>8.990</b> urt:<b>8.990</b> uct:<b>7.128</b> status:200\n</pre>\n\n<p>It turned out that very often information was logged in bursts with exactly the same timestamp, what was even more intriguing was that some of such entries\nreported the exact same time as an <em>$upstream_request_time</em> or <em>$upstream_connect_time</em>.\nLet’s say that even if you are keen on paranormal mystery, odds, that’s the moment when the big red light should start blinking.\nIt definitely looks like something deterministic, not random. In the production realm, it was even more interesting; some bursts were connected with each other\nin some strange arithmetic way - for example:</p>\n\n<p>Let’s define bursts as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>B1, B2, B3 - bursts</p>\n\n  <p>B1.TS - timestamp of the burst</p>\n\n  <p>B3.urt, B3.uct - upstream_request_time, upstream_connect_time - reported during last burst</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>then such relation was often noticed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>B1.TS + B3.uct = B2.TS</p>\n\n  <p>B1.TS + B3.urt = B3.TS</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To better understand such a relation, let’s draw it:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/bursts-relationship.png\" alt=\"Bursts relation\" /></p>\n\n<p>Having a clue that there are extended periods of time when processing for a particular process is stuck, we wanted to know what was going on when processes hung.\nWe used strace to preview what particular system calls were made during such problems. The challenge was to connect to the process when problems occur,\nbut fortunately for us (and less fortunately for our users) we did not wait a long time for the subsequent instability, and we were able to gather strace data.\nIt reveals a large number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futex\">futex</a> calls that indicated active waiting for some barer / mutex.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"connecting-the-dots\">Connecting the dots</h2>\n\n<p>As it was announced earlier, on that stage we have three actors. In order to better understand what was happening under the hood, let’s take a closer look at\neach of them.</p>\n\n<p>First of all <em>nginx</em> server, it uses\n<a href=\"https://www.nginx.com/blog/inside-nginx-how-we-designed-for-performance-scale/\">an asynchronous event-driven approach to handling connections</a>.\nIt means that a single <em>nginx</em> worker can process a large number of requests simultaneously basically because a significant part of processing a single request\nhappens outside the worker. Instead of actively waiting for a response, the nginx process uses such spare time to handle new incoming requests.\nEverything works very efficiently as long as each blocking (IO consuming) operation is handled in an asynchronous manner\n(the control is returned to event-loop).\nWhen such a requirement is unmet, the processing pace slows dramatically.</p>\n\n<p>The second actor is the ModSecurity-nginx plugin. <em>Nginx</em> plugins allow extending the logic of the server by adding custom logic.\nModSecurity-nginx plugin allows inspecting requests processed by nginx against <em>ModSecurity</em> rules.\nSuch inspection can be considered a CPU-bound operation, so even if it is called in a synchronous manner, it does not break the concept of processing\nblocking operations asynchronously.</p>\n\n<p>The third one is <em>LMDB</em>, a very efficient mapped DB that allows <strong>concurrent reads and exclusive writes</strong>. This database was used as a storage for ModSecurity\ncollections in order to share a state of collections between nginx workers.\nThe documentation and source code of this relatively small project were scrutinized many times as well as integration between ModSecurity and <em>LMDB</em>, but there\nwas no suspicion of what could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it turned out that the version of <em>ModSecurity</em> that we scrutinized was from the master branch. Moreover, the master branch contained an improvement related to misusing\n<em>LMDB</em> exclusive transactions while reading the data. Given that, we had a justified belief that issues came from exclusive transactions. It means that\nnginx workers probably block on acquiring locks.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/locking.png\" alt=\"Exclusive locking\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reproducing-the-issue-in-the-isolated-environment\">Reproducing the issue in the isolated environment</h2>\n\n<p>To reproduce the issue, we decided to use a technique that we called a fancy name: <em>exaggeration</em>.\nReproducing a problem that occurs under high traffic that is handled by powerful servers is not simple on a local workstation.\nHowever, in this case, we had some clues and justified hypotheses about what could be wrong and what part we should focus on.\nLet me explain what exaggeration means when it comes to reproducing a problem.\nSome sort of problems can be easily noticeable when the probability of the occurrence of rare events is raised to a significant level.\nIf we have different ways to increase such probability, we can use them interchangeably. I am aware that it sounds like theoretical physics, but believe me or\nnot our problems are relatively easier to solve than those worked on by the guys at LHC.</p>\n\n<p>In our case, we were pretty sure that the number of concurrent lookups on a single server to <em>ModSecurity</em> collections is a rare event.\nSo instead of loading a local server in enormous traffic we significantly increased the number of lookups to <em>LMDB</em> that were performed for each processed\nrequest.</p>\n\n<p>All below information is based on data that can be gathered from the docker\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ziollek/lmdb-modsecurity-perf-issue#what-does-the-environment-consist-of\">environment</a> that was prepared as an integral part of this article.\nIt is worth mentioning that the environment can be built in one of two modes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>regular that is way faster when it comes to building process</li>\n  <li>profiling that allows revealing the exact point where nginx processes hang based on profiling information from the kernel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would not like to deep dive into the profiling process based on kernel capabilities, but it is very cumbersome in a containerized environment because\nit breaks the isolation paradigm.\nMoreover, it is hard to prepare due to compatibility requirements between host and container libraries, header files and compilers.\nHowever, for this particular purpose it was tempting to use limited profiling tools based on <a href=\"https://ebpf.io/\">eBPF</a> that do not have such restricted\nrequirements.</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the reproducing process is feeding <em>LMDB</em> collections\nwith <a href=\"https://github.com/ziollek/lmdb-modsecurity-perf-issue#preparing-sample-data\">sample data</a>.\nWhen the collections are prepared, we can run <a href=\"https://github.com/ziollek/lmdb-modsecurity-perf-issue#testing-performance\">performance tests using ab</a>.\nBy increasing the number of lookups against <em>LMDB</em> collections during each request, it is relatively simple to reproduce low performance.\nAnalysis of access logs revealed the bursts mentioned in investigation part.</p>\n\n<p>The more interesting part was finding the exact place that caused hangs. We started from the entry point (for call inspection of the request headers) to\n<em>ModSecurity</em> from the nginx plugin, namely <strong>msc_process_request_headers</strong> function.\nWe helped ourselves with a tool <a href=\"https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/bpfcc-tools/trace-bpfcc.8.en.html\">trace-bpfcc</a> provided within package <strong>bpfcc-tools</strong>.\nBesides all other features, that tool allows logging the exact point in time when a particular function is called and when it is finished.\nWhen we analyzed the time spent on such a function, we realized that was the exact place where we should dig deeper:</p>\n\n<pre>\ntrace-bpfcc -t  'p:/usr/local/modsecurity/lib/libmodsecurity.so.3.0.6:msc_process_request_headers \"start\"' \\\n  'r:/usr/local/modsecurity/lib/libmodsecurity.so.3.0.6:msc_process_request_headers \"stop\"' \\\n  'r:/usr/local/modsecurity/lib/libmodsecurity.so.3.0.6:msc_process_logging \"stop\"' 2&gt;/dev/null\n\nTIME     PID     TID     COMM            FUNC             -\n..\n<b>3.981139 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start</b>\n6.296459 10847   10847   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.297111 10847   10847   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.309465 10844   10844   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.310118 10844   10844   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n<b>6.314868 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop</b>\n6.319024 10840   10840   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.323392 10839   10839   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.328587 10837   10837   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.332937 10843   10843   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.338358 10841   10841   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.339536 10841   10841   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.349181 10845   10845   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.367007 10838   10838   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.368100 10838   10838   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n<b>6.522875 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_logging stop</b>\n...\n</pre>\n\n<p>Please pay attention to highlighted lines related to PID=10842.\nIt turned out that the upstream responded within the required time (in the prepared environment, we are able to control the upstream latency by part of the URL path):\n6.522875 - 6.314868 ~ 200ms.\nHowever, the rest of time: <em>6.314868 - 3.981139 ~ 2.230s</em> is consumed in <strong>msc_process_request_headers</strong>, when we search for the access log entry related to\nthis processing we can see:</p>\n\n<pre>\nconnection:5824 timestamp:1700222187.657 request_time:2.440 upstream_response_time:2.439 upstream_connect_time:<b>2.235</b> upstream_header_time:<b>2.438</b> status:200 request:(GET /users/200/random?arg=unknown HTTP/1.0)\n</pre>\n\n<p>I would not bore you with the whole process of tracking down but go directly to the <em>LMDB</em> <strong>mdb_txn_begin</strong> function that starts the <em>LMDB</em> transaction.\nThat function is called for each <em>LMDB</em> lookup, so there are way more calls than in previous profiling.\nHowever, I prepared a command that allows us to aggregate all time consumed while waiting in that function.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code># trace-bpfcc -t 'p:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblmdb.so.0.0.0:mdb_txn_begin \"start\"' \\\n  'r:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblmdb.so.0.0.0:mdb_txn_begin \"stop\"' 2&gt;/dev/null | tee /tmp/benchmark.log\n# cat /tmp/benchmark.log  | sort -n | awk '{if ($6 == \"start\") { data[$2] = $1} else { summary += 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]); print $1, $2, 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]) }} END {print \"Total time spent on locking: \", summary, \"ms,  number of calls: \", calls}'\n...\nTotal time spent on locking: 105891ms number of calls:  4064\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>As a comparison, we can execute the same profiling on version with a fix.

If, despite all discouragement, you are interested in solving technical mysteries,\ntake a sip of coffee and enjoy the story!\nClever: what have we built?\nA few years ago, we researched several platforms that can be used as transparent HTTP proxies capable of handling HTTP traffic to our services.\nWe needed a solution that would be able to inspect metadata and user data against any suspicious patterns and decide if such traffic should be processed or banned.\nWe chose nginx in concert with ModSecurity as a foundation for a more complex\necosystem.\nDuring increasing usage of such a stack, more than simple non-contextual rules was needed for more complex traffic analysis. One of the most crucial needs was providing the ability to store some contextual information connected\nwith session activity in order to better recognize malicious patterns.\nBy default, ModSecurity allows storing contextual information in memory. Such an approach is not very useful in connection with HTTP servers that utilize\nmultiprocessing as nginx does.\n\nHowever, we learned that ModSecurity can use LMDB as an internal fast storage for contextual information that could be\nshared between requests that come, for example, from the same IP address. LMDB approach ensures that contextual information stored by one nginx worker process\nis accessible by others.\n\nAt first glance, it looks great; however, in our case, we could not rely on information that is stored directly by ModSecurity.\nAs you can imagine, our setup is based on more than one server, so we have to be able to pass the same contextual information to each of them.\nMoreover, our algorithms that compute such information are complex and reach for more data than those available to ModSecurity.\nNevertheless, LMDB has one great advantage: it allows connecting to it from outside the nginx process and altering the contextual data that is available to\nModSecurity.\nWe built a mechanism that syncs contextual information from dedicated service to LMDB on each transparent proxy host.\nA simplified view of the architecture that allows computing and synchronizing contextual information is depicted below (dotted lines represent asynchronous flow):\n\nSuch a PoC gave us promising results regarding how fast the contextual information could be provided and how fast it was retrieved by ModSecurity.\nFinally, we rolled out the new approach, and everything worked smoothly for such a long time that we assumed it was a rock-solid solution.\nSurprised: once upon a time, the problem occurred for the first time\nWe noticed that response time from the client’s perspective soared, and the number of established connections also increased.\nSuch a correlation is not strange and was noticed many times in the past when the upstream that handles requests from proxy started responding slower.\nWhat was mysterious in that case was that there was no evidence of a problem on the upstream side besides the metric from nginx that was based on\n$upstream_connect_time.\nAccording to that metric, connecting to the upstream had slowed down significantly.\nHaving such a clue we blamed the part of infrastructure that is always to blame if no one knows what is happening.\nAs you probably guessed, we assumed that was a temporary network issue (from my experience, it is the best justification to not dig more profound).\nUnfortunately, the network issue started occurring quite often, at least a few times a week.\nStrangely enough, if we disable the transparent proxy, the network seems to be stable. Once again, we were convinced that someone from the network team devised blameless culture.\nHence, we started to verify a lot of new hypotheses, from those scary (cyber war, specialized attacks that are hidden in regular traffic) to those that bring\nsmiles upon our faces at least for today (backdoor left by Russian spy in the nginx source code).\nFalsification of those hypotheses that were at least partially backed up by data is a great story about how to teach engineers that correlation does not mean\ncausation.\nTurn gray: investigation\nLet me introduce a simplified view of our infrastructure to show where we gathered data.\n\nAll proxies measure at least the total processing time, including the time consumed in the proxy and the time that was consumed outside the proxy (passing the\nrequest to the next server in the above chain and waiting for the response).\nAnd those parts could be analyzed independently. Based on such measurements, we can simply compute the approximate overhead of the proxy as a difference between the whole\nrequest (green box) processing and the upstream (red box) waiting.\nHaving that, we were able to discover that the time consumed in transparent proxy was not increased significantly; only the time consumed outside of proxy was\nraised (red box).\nIt was one of the big lies that hindered revealing the truth. You can find a broader explanation of misleading metrics in the lessons learned part.\nAfter excluding network issues, and upstream issues, we were pretty sure that the problem lay in transparent proxy, and we started to doubt what we saw in\nmetrics.\nIt took a while, but finally, we were able to break our unwavering trust in data. Relying on data is encoded in our company DNA, so trusting it was a natural\ninstinct, unfortunately, a bad one in this case.\nHaving that, we could not rely on metrics provided by a transparent proxy. We were starting to try out other means to measure what was going on inside the\ntransparent proxy.\nBeing biased by network issues, we started gathering a lot of network-related information that only showed correlations with problems, but it did not give any\nclues about what was happening.\nIt was a time to use the more straightforward but quite heavy solution - access logs. However, logs are not very useful in giving the overall condition of the proxy;\nthey can be beneficial in analyzing singular problems.\nWhen the problems occurred again, we had some data that we could scrutinize. It turned out that an excellent idea was to log exact timestamps in\na very high resolution (which was not default).\nBelow, you can see a real example reproduced in the local environment (which will be described later).\nEach line contains nginx worker process id, timestamp, request_time, upstream_request_time, upstream_connect_time and the response status code.\n8.990 urt:8.990 uct:7.128 status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:12.348 urt:12.348 uct:3.358 status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:8.990 urt:8.990 uct:7.128 status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:8.990 urt:8.990 uct:7.128 status:200\n\n\nIt turned out that very often information was logged in bursts with exactly the same timestamp, what was even more intriguing was that some of such entries\nreported the exact same time as an $upstream_request_time or $upstream_connect_time.\nLet’s say that even if you are keen on paranormal mystery, odds, that’s the moment when the big red light should start blinking.\nIt definitely looks like something deterministic, not random. In the production realm, it was even more interesting; some bursts were connected with each other\nin some strange arithmetic way - for example:\nLet’s define bursts as:\nB1, B2, B3 - bursts\nB1.TS - timestamp of the burst\nB3.urt, B3.uct - upstream_request_time, upstream_connect_time - reported during last burst\nthen such relation was often noticed:\nB1.TS + B3.uct = B2.TS\nB1.TS + B3.urt = B3.TS\nTo better understand such a relation, let’s draw it:\n\nHaving a clue that there are extended periods of time when processing for a particular process is stuck, we wanted to know what was going on when processes hung.\nWe used strace to preview what particular system calls were made during such problems. The challenge was to connect to the process when problems occur,\nbut fortunately for us (and less fortunately for our users) we did not wait a long time for the subsequent instability, and we were able to gather strace data.\nIt reveals a large number of futex calls that indicated active waiting for some barer / mutex.\nConnecting the dots\nAs it was announced earlier, on that stage we have three actors. In order to better understand what was happening under the hood, let’s take a closer look at\neach of them.\nFirst of all nginx server, it uses\nan asynchronous event-driven approach to handling connections.\nIt means that a single nginx worker can process a large number of requests simultaneously basically because a significant part of processing a single request\nhappens outside the worker. Instead of actively waiting for a response, the nginx process uses such spare time to handle new incoming requests.\nEverything works very efficiently as long as each blocking (IO consuming) operation is handled in an asynchronous manner\n(the control is returned to event-loop).\nWhen such a requirement is unmet, the processing pace slows dramatically.\nThe second actor is the ModSecurity-nginx plugin. Nginx plugins allow extending the logic of the server by adding custom logic.\nModSecurity-nginx plugin allows inspecting requests processed by nginx against ModSecurity rules.\nSuch inspection can be considered a CPU-bound operation, so even if it is called in a synchronous manner, it does not break the concept of processing\nblocking operations asynchronously.\nThe third one is LMDB, a very efficient mapped DB that allows concurrent reads and exclusive writes. This database was used as a storage for ModSecurity\ncollections in order to share a state of collections between nginx workers.\nThe documentation and source code of this relatively small project were scrutinized many times as well as integration between ModSecurity and LMDB, but there\nwas no suspicion of what could be wrong.\nFinally, it turned out that the version of ModSecurity that we scrutinized was from the master branch. Moreover, the master branch contained an improvement related to misusing\nLMDB exclusive transactions while reading the data. Given that, we had a justified belief that issues came from exclusive transactions. It means that\nnginx workers probably block on acquiring locks.\n\nReproducing the issue in the isolated environment\nTo reproduce the issue, we decided to use a technique that we called a fancy name: exaggeration.\nReproducing a problem that occurs under high traffic that is handled by powerful servers is not simple on a local workstation.\nHowever, in this case, we had some clues and justified hypotheses about what could be wrong and what part we should focus on.\nLet me explain what exaggeration means when it comes to reproducing a problem.\nSome sort of problems can be easily noticeable when the probability of the occurrence of rare events is raised to a significant level.\nIf we have different ways to increase such probability, we can use them interchangeably. I am aware that it sounds like theoretical physics, but believe me or\nnot our problems are relatively easier to solve than those worked on by the guys at LHC.\nIn our case, we were pretty sure that the number of concurrent lookups on a single server to ModSecurity collections is a rare event.\nSo instead of loading a local server in enormous traffic we significantly increased the number of lookups to LMDB that were performed for each processed\nrequest.\nAll below information is based on data that can be gathered from the docker\nenvironment that was prepared as an integral part of this article.\nIt is worth mentioning that the environment can be built in one of two modes:\nregular that is way faster when it comes to building process\nprofiling that allows revealing the exact point where nginx processes hang based on profiling information from the kernel\nI would not like to deep dive into the profiling process based on kernel capabilities, but it is very cumbersome in a containerized environment because\nit breaks the isolation paradigm.\nMoreover, it is hard to prepare due to compatibility requirements between host and container libraries, header files and compilers.\nHowever, for this particular purpose it was tempting to use limited profiling tools based on eBPF that do not have such restricted\nrequirements.\nThe first part of the reproducing process is feeding LMDB collections\nwith sample data.\nWhen the collections are prepared, we can run performance tests using ab.\nBy increasing the number of lookups against LMDB collections during each request, it is relatively simple to reproduce low performance.\nAnalysis of access logs revealed the bursts mentioned in investigation part.\nThe more interesting part was finding the exact place that caused hangs. We started from the entry point (for call inspection of the request headers) to\nModSecurity from the nginx plugin, namely msc_process_request_headers function.\nWe helped ourselves with a tool trace-bpfcc provided within package bpfcc-tools.\nBesides all other features, that tool allows logging the exact point in time when a particular function is called and when it is finished.\nWhen we analyzed the time spent on such a function, we realized that was the exact place where we should dig deeper:\n3.981139 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.296459 10847   10847   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.297111 10847   10847   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.309465 10844   10844   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.310118 10844   10844   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.314868 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.319024 10840   10840   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.323392 10839   10839   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.328587 10837   10837   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.332937 10843   10843   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.338358 10841   10841   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.339536 10841   10841   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.349181 10845   10845   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.367007 10838   10838   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.368100 10838   10838   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.522875 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_logging stop\n...\n\n\nPlease pay attention to highlighted lines related to PID=10842.\nIt turned out that the upstream responded within the required time (in the prepared environment, we are able to control the upstream latency by part of the URL path):\n6.522875 - 6.314868 ~ 200ms.\nHowever, the rest of time: 6.314868 - 3.981139 ~ 2.230s is consumed in msc_process_request_headers, when we search for the access log entry related to\nthis processing we can see:\n2.235 upstream_header_time:2.438 status:200 request:(GET /users/200/random?arg=unknown HTTP/1.0)\n\n\nI would not bore you with the whole process of tracking down but go directly to the LMDB mdb_txn_begin function that starts the LMDB transaction.\nThat function is called for each LMDB lookup, so there are way more calls than in previous profiling.\nHowever, I prepared a command that allows us to aggregate all time consumed while waiting in that function.\n\n# trace-bpfcc -t 'p:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblmdb.so.0.0.0:mdb_txn_begin \"start\"' \\\n  'r:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblmdb.so.0.0.0:mdb_txn_begin \"stop\"' 2>/dev/null | tee /tmp/benchmark.log\n# cat /tmp/benchmark.log  | sort -n | awk '{if ($6 == \"start\") { data[$2] = $1} else { summary += 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]); print $1, $2, 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]) }} END {print \"Total time spent on locking: \", summary, \"ms,  number of calls: \", calls}'\n...\nTotal time spent on locking: 105891ms number of calls:  4064\n\n\nAs a comparison, we can execute the same profiling on version with a fix. Such a version is also available in a prepared environment.\n\ncat /tmp/benchmark.log  | sort -n | awk '{if ($6 == \"start\") { data[$2] = $1} else { calls++; summary += 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]); print $1, $2, 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]) }} END {print \"Total time spent on locking: \", summary, \"ms,  number of calls: \", calls}'\n...\nTotal time spent on locking: 1811.19ms  number of calls:  4064\n\n\nFixing the fix\nAs I have mentioned before, during the investigation we inspected source code that partially solves the problem.\nIt turned out that the fix merged to master does not work at all with the nginx plugin because of some initialization problems.\nThe PR that fixes the found problem has been merged and released in version 3.0.7 of ModSecurity.\nLessons learned\nMake sure that you inspect the exact version of the source code that you run\nOne of the struggles that we faced was scrutinizing the version of ModSecurity that had partially fixed the problem with exclusive read access to LMDB.\nFor sure, we had bad luck that the fix was available in master and not in the last released version that we then used, but at least we can confirm that the\ndevil is in the details.\nInstrumentation overhead\nWhen using such low level profiling methods you have to bear in mind that approach is quite invasive.\nIt means that such observation impacts the observed process.\nIt implies that it is hard to distinguish if we are observing root problems or just a consequence of harnessing very heavy instrumentation.\nSo, it is risky to draw conclusions from such observations.\nVerify your assumptions\nOur lack of understanding of how the particular phases of processing requests are computed led us to the false assumption that we could compute approximate\nModSecurity overhead by using simple arithmetic: request time - upstream time.\n\nIt was one of the biggest mistakes that hindered revealing the truth. It turned out that part of ModSecurity processing was included into upstream time,\nso the red part on above diagram also includes ModSecurity processing that is not part of establishing connection. As a form of self-punishment,\nwe extended the nginx-ModSecurity plugin in such a way that it allows measuring the overhead of\neach ModSecurity phase in a reliable way.\nLog timestamps\nIt may seem redundant because many logger collectors by default add their own timestamp of the moment when log entries are received in the collector.\nHowever, having a timestamp from the moment when the log is produced (without any delays) is crucial to reveal suspicious patterns/hangs on the producer\nside that can not be observed if timestamps are affected by random lags.\nDo (not) abuse undocumented behavior\nOne of the reasons that we faced this issue was abusing usage of ModSecurity collections.\nIn regular and documented usage such collections\nare considered to be simple key-value storage.\nWe discovered that under each key, we are able to store a list of values instead of a single value. If you consciously scanned the provided repository\n(especially ModSecurity rules) you could probably find a way to simulate a situation where multiple values are fetched while reading a single key.\nLet’s look at a rule that is available in the repository\n\nSecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:x-set-sample \"@eq 1\" \"phase:1,setvar:global.sample%{REQUEST_HEADERS:x-set-sample}=%{REQUEST_HEADERS:x-set-sample},log,deny,status:403,id:50,msg:'value of sample header is blocked',tag:'priority:1',tag:'action:deny'\"\n\n\nIf we call above rule with x-set-sample header with subsequent values 1, 2, 3. We can do that by making HTTP requests as below:\n\nworkstation # docker-compose exec nginx-before-fix bash\nnginx-with-lmdb # curl -I -H'x-set-sample: 1' localhost\nnginx-with-lmdb # curl -I -H'x-set-sample: 2' localhost\nnginx-with-lmdb # curl -I -H'x-set-sample: 3' localhost\n\n\nThen, we can expect that there will be stored three key-value pairs:\nglobals[sample1]=1\nglobals[sample2]=2\nglobals[sample3]=3\nIndeed, when we try to read LMDB in a very naive approach, values are stored the way we expect. We can see something like that:\n\nnginx-with-lmdb # strings /tmp/modsec-shared-collections\nsample::::sample11\nsample::::sample22\nsample::::sample33\n\n\nThe following rule that is interesting is supposed to check if a value under a particular key is equal to a query param.\nBasically, if the request contains query parameter arg=1, then we check if the value in the collection global, under the key sample is also “1”.\nIf the condition is met then the request will be blocked, which means that 403 status code will be returned.\n\nSecRule ARGS_GET \".*\" \"chain,phase:1,log,capture,deny,status:403,id:1001,msg:'value of param %{TX.0} is blocked',setvar:tx.param=%{TX.0}\"\n    SecRule global.sample \"@streq %{tx.param}\" \"t:none\"\n\n\nYou may be confused why we are reading the key sample that was never set.\nLet’s look what happens when we try to make a request with value 1 and -1.\nAs I described earlier, our intention was to check if global[sample] == 1.\n\nnginx-with-lmdb  # curl -I \"http://localhost/users/200/random?arg=1\"\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nServer: nginx/1.22.0 (Ubuntu)\nDate: Fri, 17 Nov 2023 10:58:39 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 162\nConnection: keep-alive\nnginx-with-lmdb\n\nnginx-with-lmdb  # curl -I \"http://localhost/users/200/random?arg=-1\"\nHTTP/1.1 200\nServer: nginx/1.22.0 (Ubuntu)\nDate: Fri, 17 Nov 2023 10:58:42 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 79\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n\n\nQuite interesting?

A feature that makes the tree balanced all the time is called self-balancing.\nSelf-balancing algorithm by example\nBuilding a B-tree can be started simply by creating a single node\nand adding new values until there is no free space in it.\n\nIf there is no space on the corresponding page, it needs to be split.\nTo perform a split, a „split point” is chosen.\nIn that case, it will be 12, because it is in the middle.\nThe „Split point” is a value that will be moved to the upper page.\n\nNow, it gets us to an interesting point where there is no upper page.\nIn such a case, a new one needs to be generated (and it becomes the new root page!).\n\nAnd finally, there is some free space in the three, so value 14 may be added.\n\nFollowing this algorithm, we may constantly add new values to the B-tree, and it will remain balanced all the time!\n\nAt this point, you may have a valid concern that there is a lot of free space that has no chance to be\nfilled.\nFor example, values 14, 15, and 16, are on different pages, so these pages will remain with only one value and two free spaces forever.\nIt was caused by the split location choice.\nWe always split the page in the middle.\nBut every time we do a split, we may choose any split location we want.\nPostgres has an algorithm that is run every time a split is performed!\nIts implementation may be found in the _bt_findsplitloc() function in Postgres source code.\nIts goal is to leave as little free space as possible.\nSummary\nIn this article, you learned how a B-tree works.\nAll in all, it may be simply described as a Binary Search Tree with two changes:\nevery node may contain more than one value\ninserting a new value is followed by a self-balancing algorithm.\nAlthough the structures used by modern databases are usually some variants of a B-tree (like B+tree), they are still based on the original conception.\nIn my opinion, one great strength of a B-tree is the fact that it was designed directly to handle large amounts of data on actual hardware.\nIt may be the reason why the B-tree has remained with us for such a long time.","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/11/how-does-btree-make-your-queries-fast.html","categories":["tech"],"isoDate":"2023-11-26T23:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"},{"title":"Beyond the Code - An Engineer’s Battle Against Knowledge Loss","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/10/battle-against-knowledge-loss.html","pubDate":"Mon, 30 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0100","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Krzysztof Przychodzki"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/krzysztof.przychodzki.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/krzysztof.przychodzki"]}]},"content":"<p>The idea for this article arose during a meeting where we learned that our supervisor would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.

This term encompasses nearly every employee in a company. I\nunderstand that nobody wants to be seen as just a resource, and certainly not as part of the <em>Biological Data Storage</em>. However, in the context of a company’s\nresources, an employee can be likened to a technical data repository, but with the valuable addition of context.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to examine this issue more broadly from an engineer’s perspective.

Companies have ways of dealing with them, but do they,\nreally?</p>\n\n<p><em>Organizations have no memory</em> is a quote from Trevor Kletz’s book <em>Lessons from Disaster</em>, which highlights the concept of organizational memory and how\nincidents and accidents can recur due to the lack of effective learning from past mistakes within an organization. Prof. Kletz highlights the organization’s\ninability to learn from accidents, even those occurring within the company. I sometimes feel that a similar pattern emerges when knowledge departs from our\ncompany. Perhaps because it can’t be easily measured in money, it’s often downplayed.</p>\n\n<p>While Kletz’s book pertains to chemical engineering, I see several universal truths that apply to any situation and industry.

Creating documentation is one thing, but keeping it up-to-date within an organization (regardless of\nits size) is a challenge. Encouraging the team to regularly update documentation is also a challenge.

When creating new things, we make numerous decisions that may appear irrational without the right context later on. ADRs are like opening\na box that explains why these decisions were made.

Thanks to documentation and ADR we can significantly reduce this time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"an-alternative-to-lengthy-documentation\">An alternative to lengthy documentation?</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No one reads.\nIf someone does read, he doesn’t understand.\nIf he understands, he immediately forgets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, just as is the case in the above quote from Stanisław Lem <sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>, the problem with documentation, procedures, and ADRs is that people need to\nfamiliarize themselves with them. I suppose that even at SpaceX, it’s doubtful this would be considered the most thrilling reading material, or maybe I am just\nmistaken. Anyway, even if someone manages to get through the documentation, they’ll only retain what they understand. We’re presented with the work of others,\nwith their imposed ways of thinking and decision-making. Often, questions arise to which no one knows the answers, and the people who do know are no longer with\nthe company.</p>\n\n<p>Since we now know our mental limitations, instead of forcing people to sift through stacks of documentation, we can\nuse <a href=\"https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/07/event-storming-workshops.html\">EventStorming</a>. This technique helps understand business processes, identify events and\nactivities, and integrate knowledge in an understandable way. We focus on behaviors, on what changes and why. Together, we develop a solution and understand the\nprocesses because we see them from start to finish. Understanding a process through EventStorming is faster and easier than reading documentation. During an\nEventStorming session, most questions find answers, and knowledge can be conveyed to many people simultaneously, whether they are technical or not. The most\nsignificant artifact of such sessions is that you can discuss why the process looks the way it does, why a specific sequence was chosen, and not another —\nessentially, a mega-mix of documentation, ADR, and conversation. I emphasize once more that this understanding of the process is developed collectively —\neveryone feels as a part of the solution. In the case of our <em>BDS</em>, EventStorming is like capturing the thoughts of experts when making crucial decisions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"real-life-example\">Real life example</h3>\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://allegro.tech/\">Allegro</a>, we recently had a situation where the entire development team responsible for a critical service was moved to a different\nproject. The new team, which inherited the service, had the opportunity to collaborate with the departing team for a period. However, in this context, we also\nconducted EventStorming sessions. To provide more detail, these sessions extended over two full days, each lasting 8 hours. The knowledge accumulated over the\npast five years was not merely confined to two plotter paper-sized sheets, each stretching 6 meters in length, but was primarily assimilated within the\nparticipants’ minds in a seamless manner. I believe this facilitated the new team in gaining greater confidence when taking over the domain.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, you don’t need to spend a lot of time on EventStorming to uncover enough business knowledge. In the case mentioned earlier, the session lasted\ntwo days, but it involved an entire team. For an individual, a two-hour workshop can be enough to see the big picture of our process. Although EventStorming\nallows us to absorb a dose of knowledge relatively easily to know <em>what and why</em> is changing in our process, the devil is in the detail. To really understand\n<em>how</em> this process is changing, it’s best to start by doing small tasks under the guidance of an experienced person.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"seeking-uml-like-alternatives\">Seeking UML-like Alternatives?</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, EventStorming is not the answer to all knowledge loss-related problems. While I don’t question how fantastic this tool is, the knowledge acquired\nthrough it will remain only in the participants’ minds. If it’s not somehow preserved in the form of documentation or ADRs, it may turn out to be just as\nfleeting as departing employees. What can be done about this? Our initial thoughts may lead us to create some form of description or documentation, which, as we\nknow, comes with the challenge of its preparation and the cognitive overload for someone trying to assimilate new knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that when dealing with the issue of knowledge loss and its effective transfer, it’s worth mentioning tools like BPMN, which stands for Business Process\nModel and Notation. BPMN provides a standardized graphical representation of business processes. By using BPMN diagrams, we can visually map\nworkflows and procedures. Such an approach not only simplifies the understanding of complex processes but also aids in comprehensive documentation. When\ncombined with other knowledge-sharing techniques, such as EventStorming, BPMN can be a powerful asset in preserving and transferring critical business\nknowledge.</p>\n\n<p>However, BPMN has an elaborate set of symbols and notation rules, which can make creating and interpreting diagrams complicated for some individuals. Creating\nadvanced BPMN diagrams and fully utilizing the notation’s potential requires specialized knowledge and experience. People unfamiliar with BPMN may struggle\nto use it effectively. Despite these inconveniences, BPMN still remains a valuable tool for modeling and documenting business processes in many organizations. I\nbelieve it complements the previously mentioned techniques perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>Just remember to have the right tools in your arsenal and, more importantly, to choose the appropriate tool for the situation, considering both its strengths\nand weaknesses.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"one-more-thing\">One more thing…</h2>\n\n<p><em>Time to Problem Resolution</em> metric serves as a clear indicator of an organization’s efficiency in addressing challenges. A shorter time to resolution signifies\nthat issues are tackled swiftly, minimizing disruptions and ensuring that the organization operates smoothly.\n<em>Knowledge Transfer Rate</em> metric is a means to quantify and address the loss of knowledge, shedding light on its impact on communication structures and system\ndesign within an organization.</p>\n\n<p>Both metrics are directly influenced by the use of appropriate tools such as documentation, ADRs, EventStorming or BPMN. I have tried to highlight their\nadvantages and disadvantages in the context of knowledge transfer.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is another challenge - changing the company’s culture. Employees must know what tools they have and feel that sharing knowledge is key to\nsuccess. Leadership plays a crucial role here, as leaders need to actively promote and engage in knowledge sharing and open communication. If company leaders\nactively endorse and engage in knowledge sharing, other employees are more likely to follow suit. However, changing organizational culture is a time-consuming\nprocess. Patience and perseverance are essential until new behaviors and beliefs prevail over old ones.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"this-can-be-done\">This can be done</h2>\n\n<p>As an engineer in an organisation, regardless of size, there are several proactive steps you can take to facilitate knowledge transfer. First and foremost,\nactively engage in open communication with your colleagues. Encourage discussion and information sharing, especially within your area of expertise, to ensure\nthat valuable insights are shared. Second, mentorship can be a powerful tool. Offer to mentor junior team members or be open to seeking guidance from more\nexperienced colleagues. In addition, participate in knowledge-sharing initiatives within the company, such as brown bag sessions, workshops or cross-functional\nprojects. Finally, consider creating or contributing to internal documentation and repositories. These resources can serve as valuable references for your\ncolleagues and future team members, ensuring that knowledge is retained within the organisation. By actively participating in these practices, you can play a\nkey role in preserving and transferring critical knowledge within your organisation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>In this article, I aimed to discuss how knowledge loss in a company appears through an engineer’s eyes and why it can pose a threat. The term <em>Biological Data\nStorage</em> may sound unconventional, but it emphasises the critical role that every team member plays in preserving and transferring knowledge. It’s important to\nremember that employees are not just resources; they are the living repositories of valuable information, experience and expertise. In the world of <em>BDS</em>, every\nmember contributes to the collective body of knowledge, shaping the organisation’s communication structure.\nAs we say goodbye to departing colleagues, let’s also say goodbye to the notion that knowledge should be confined to individual minds. Instead, let’s adopt a\nculture of open communication, active knowledge sharing and the right tools, such as EventStorming and BPMN, to capture, preserve and share critical knowledge\nacross our organisation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"footnotes\">Footnotes</h3>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>Quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law <a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem <a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n","contentSnippet":"The idea for this article arose during a meeting where we learned that our supervisor would be leaving the company to pursue new opportunities.

When\ncombined with other knowledge-sharing techniques, such as EventStorming, BPMN can be a powerful asset in preserving and transferring critical business\nknowledge.\nHowever, BPMN has an elaborate set of symbols and notation rules, which can make creating and interpreting diagrams complicated for some individuals. Creating\nadvanced BPMN diagrams and fully utilizing the notation’s potential requires specialized knowledge and experience. People unfamiliar with BPMN may struggle\nto use it effectively. Despite these inconveniences, BPMN still remains a valuable tool for modeling and documenting business processes in many organizations. I\nbelieve it complements the previously mentioned techniques perfectly.\nJust remember to have the right tools in your arsenal and, more importantly, to choose the appropriate tool for the situation, considering both its strengths\nand weaknesses.\nOne more thing…\nTime to Problem Resolution metric serves as a clear indicator of an organization’s efficiency in addressing challenges. A shorter time to resolution signifies\nthat issues are tackled swiftly, minimizing disruptions and ensuring that the organization operates smoothly.\nKnowledge Transfer Rate metric is a means to quantify and address the loss of knowledge, shedding light on its impact on communication structures and system\ndesign within an organization.\nBoth metrics are directly influenced by the use of appropriate tools such as documentation, ADRs, EventStorming or BPMN. I have tried to highlight their\nadvantages and disadvantages in the context of knowledge transfer.\nHowever, there is another challenge - changing the company’s culture. Employees must know what tools they have and feel that sharing knowledge is key to\nsuccess. Leadership plays a crucial role here, as leaders need to actively promote and engage in knowledge sharing and open communication. If company leaders\nactively endorse and engage in knowledge sharing, other employees are more likely to follow suit. However, changing organizational culture is a time-consuming\nprocess. Patience and perseverance are essential until new behaviors and beliefs prevail over old ones.\nThis can be done\nAs an engineer in an organisation, regardless of size, there are several proactive steps you can take to facilitate knowledge transfer. First and foremost,\nactively engage in open communication with your colleagues. Encourage discussion and information sharing, especially within your area of expertise, to ensure\nthat valuable insights are shared. Second, mentorship can be a powerful tool. Offer to mentor junior team members or be open to seeking guidance from more\nexperienced colleagues. In addition, participate in knowledge-sharing initiatives within the company, such as brown bag sessions, workshops or cross-functional\nprojects. Finally, consider creating or contributing to internal documentation and repositories. These resources can serve as valuable references for your\ncolleagues and future team members, ensuring that knowledge is retained within the organisation. By actively participating in these practices, you can play a\nkey role in preserving and transferring critical knowledge within your organisation.\nSummary\nIn this article, I aimed to discuss how knowledge loss in a company appears through an engineer’s eyes and why it can pose a threat. The term Biological Data\nStorage may sound unconventional, but it emphasises the critical role that every team member plays in preserving and transferring knowledge. It’s important to\nremember that employees are not just resources; they are the living repositories of valuable information, experience and expertise. In the world of BDS, every\nmember contributes to the collective body of knowledge, shaping the organisation’s communication structure.\nAs we say goodbye to departing colleagues, let’s also say goodbye to the notion that knowledge should be confined to individual minds. Instead, let’s adopt a\nculture of open communication, active knowledge sharing and the right tools, such as EventStorming and BPMN, to capture, preserve and share critical knowledge\nacross our organisation.\nFootnotes\nQuote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law ↩\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem ↩","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/10/battle-against-knowledge-loss.html","categories":["eventstorming","knowledge-preservation","tech","communication"],"isoDate":"2023-10-29T23:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/eventstorming.png"}],"jobs":[{"id":"743999958525968","name":"Software Engineer Java -
