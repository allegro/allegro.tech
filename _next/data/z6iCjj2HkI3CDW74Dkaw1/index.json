This article discusses one of the backend application\narchitecture styles which proved to be successful in providing a good foundation for building and maintaining an\napplication in the long run: Onion Architecture.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"onion-architecture\">Onion Architecture</h2>\n\n<p>Onion Architecture is a software architectural style which strongly promotes the separation of concerns between the most\nimportant part of a business application — the domain code — and its technical aspects like HTTP or database. It does so\nwith ideas similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)\">Hexagonal Architecture</a>,\n<a href=\"/2021/12/clean-architecture-story.html\">Clean Architecture</a> and\n<a href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\">other related architecture styles</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This post gives a description of the ideas of Onion Architecture and discusses a sample implementation which explicitly\ndefines layers in the code and build setup.</p>\n\n<p>Additional complexity to the build setup and extra learning curve introduced by the layered approach pays back during\ndevelopment. It reduces the cognitive load on the programmer by giving a more concrete structural foundation and guidance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-repository\">The Repository</h3>\n\n<p>The code samples are taken from an example repository, which you can find\non <a href=\"https://github.com/tarczynskitomek/onion-library\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-does-software-architecture-matter\">Why does Software Architecture matter?</h3>\n\n<p>During my Engineering career, I’ve worked on multiple projects using different architectural styles. From a happy-go-lucky\napproach without any obvious structure, through “classic”<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> three-tier enterprise style, to highly structured\narchitecture, reflected by the setup of the build tool and supported by the compiler.</p>\n\n<p>The experience of working on those projects was also very different. Having to introduce a change in a shapeless blob of\nspaghetti code was always a painful experience, connected with stressful moments of <em>Have I broken something?</em> Or <em>Oh\nno! A gazillion of unrelated tests broke…</em></p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, working in a more rigid, but at the same time more expressive, and structured environment of\na well-architected application, was a breeze and a real pleasure. Not to mention that the time required to introduce the\nchange was smaller, and the estimates were more precise and predictable.</p>\n\n<p>Good architecture guides the implementation makes it easy to introduce new changes, and — to some degree — prevents\nless experienced team members from making doubtful decisions. It allows developers to focus on the value-providing\nimplementation rather than thinking <em>Hmm where should I put this class?</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, software architecture is often defined as <em>the things that are hard to change</em>, so choosing a proper\narchitectural approach to your new application is of key importance to its future development and maintenance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"about-the-onion\">About the Onion</h3>\n\n<p>The idea of Onion Architecture, first introduced by Jeffrey Palermo in\na <a href=\"https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/\">series of articles</a>, is similar to other clean\narchitecture approaches presented in Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin’s\n<a href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html\">blog post</a>, his book\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164\">Clean Architecture</a>, and\nquite recently on our <a href=\"/2021/12/clean-architecture-story.html\">blog</a>. It can be successfully used as an alternative to a\npopular Hexagonal / Ports and Adapters architecture, and as such is predominantly used in the backend, business\napplications and services.</p>\n\n<p>The core concept in all the above styles is the same — to make the domain the most central part of the application, and\nremove all infrastructure concerns, such as talking via HTTP, messaging, database mapping, testing, etc., away from the\ndomain code. The core of the business logic should be free (in theory at least) from any of the technical, and\nframework-related problems, allowing for easy testing and rapid development.</p>\n\n<p>To put it using Uncle Bob’s words: <em>Though these architectures all vary somewhat in their details, they are very\nsimilar. They all have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns. They all achieve this separation by\ndividing the software into layers. Each has at least one layer for business rules, and another for interfaces</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The main difference I’ve found in the implementations of Hexagonal Architecture and Onion Architecture lies mostly in\nthe overall, more structured approach to the code layout of the latter. Both styles rely on the conscious usage of\ninterfaces, and the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Dependency Inversion Principle</code>, which is the layer and encapsulation, but the Onion, like a real vegetable, has explicitly defined layers. Making the concept a\nfirst-class citizen represented in the code guides implementation and gives more clear overall structure to the\ncodebase.</p>\n\n<p>This Architecture style does have some learning curve for developers in the project, but once mastered, pays back many\ntimes. Finally, as with every solution in the IT industry, it is not a one-size-fits-all, and you should always consider\nif the architectural style matches your needs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-onion-has-layers\">The Onion has Layers</h3>\n\n<p>Onion Architecture is a form of layered architecture. The main difference between “the classic” three-tier architecture\nand the Onion, is that every outer layer sees classes from all inner layers, not only the one directly below. Moreover,\nthe dependency direction always goes from the outside to the inside, never the other way around.</p>\n\n<p>But wait, what are the layers of Onion Architecture, what do they describe, and why do they matter?</p>\n\n<p>There are three<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> main layers in Onion Architecture:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The domain layer</li>\n  <li>The application layer</li>\n  <li>The infrastructure layer\neach of which has its responsibilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-13-onion-architecture/onion-layers.png\" alt=\"Onion Architecture Layers\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-domain-layer\">The Domain Layer</h4>\n\n<p>This is the layer where you place classes describing the core of your business.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s use a simple example. An application written to help manage a Library would most probably have classes like Book,\nReader, Copy and so on. The classes, relations and interactions between them describe the core of the domain of the\napplication, i.e. what business needs it fulfils and in what way. In the Library, there would be a process of adding new\ntitles to the catalogue, a process of borrowing and returning copies of a book, charging readers for overdue books, and\nmany more.</p>\n\n<p>A sample domain class could look like the one below:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-java highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>\n<span

Thus, it should not be concerned which database is used in the\nproject, nor should it know which communication style, synchronous RPC calls, asynchronous messaging, or a mix of is\nused to trigger the logic or maybe that it’s triggered by unit tests and not real user interactions. This doesn’t mean\nof course, that the domain classes can’t have any dependencies. Like it the example above — the code uses Lombok\nannotations, generating the boilerplate which otherwise needs to be written by the programmer.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-application-layer\">The Application Layer</h4>\n\n<p>This is the layer where you place your classes, which describe the use cases of the application and coordinate the work\nof the domain classes. For example, we can imagine that a new title added to the library undergoes an approval process:\nthe book is fetched from the repository, a timestamp of approval is generated, the book state (only new books can be\napproved) is checked, and if it’s OK, a modified book is then saved using the repository.</p>\n\n<p>The code describing such a use case can look like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-java highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">Books</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// other fields and methods omitted   </span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"nc\">BookSnapshot</span> <span class=\"nf\">approve</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">BookId</span> <span class=\"n\">id</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">transactions</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">execute</span><span class=\"o\">(()</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"kd\">final</span> <span class=\"nc\">Book</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">bookRepository</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">getById</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">id</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n            <span class=\"kd\">final</span> <span class=\"nc\">ApprovedAt</span> <span class=\"n\">approvedAt</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nc\">ApprovedAt</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">timeMachine</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">now</span><span class=\"o\">());</span>\n            <span class=\"kd\">final</span> <span class=\"nc\">Book</span> <span class=\"n\">approved</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">book</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">approve</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">approvedAt</span><span class=\"o\">);</span>\n            <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">bookRepository</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">update</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">approved</span><span class=\"o\">).</span><span class=\"na\">snapshot</span><span class=\"o\">();</span>\n        <span class=\"o\">});</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is also the layer that “knows” which operations should be performed atomically, thus the transaction-related code\nis placed here.

It tends to\nbe the most “thick” since it contains the implementations of the interfaces defined in the inner layers. Need an\nHTTP controller, a message listener or a database adapter (an implementation of repository interface defined at the domain layer)? Infrastructure is the place to go.</p>\n\n<p>The domain, although the most important part of the application, tends to be also the smallest in terms of code size.\nThe reverse is true about the infrastructure code — all the supporting mechanisms, which are placed at the\ninfrastructure layer, are the backbone which animates the domain behaviour, and as such that part of the service should\nnot be neglected.</p>\n\n<p>Staying with the example of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Transactions</code> interface, let’s take a look at possible implementations. A simple approach\nusing Spring’s programmatic transaction handling could look like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-java highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>\n<span class=\"nd\">@Component</span>\n<span class=\"nd\">@AllArgsConstructor</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">JdbcTransactions</span> <span class=\"kd\">implements</span> <span class=\"nc\">Transactions</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n\n    <span class=\"kd\">private</span> <span class=\"kd\">final</span> <span class=\"nc\">TransactionTemplate</span> <span class=\"n\">transactionTemplate</span><span class=\"o\">;</span>\n\n    <span class=\"nd\">@Override</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"no\">T</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"no\">T</span> <span class=\"nf\">execute</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">Supplier</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"no\">T</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">operation</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">transactionTemplate</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">execute</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">status</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">operation</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">get</span><span class=\"o\">());</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>and for unit test, one can set up a fake, noop implementation:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-java highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"nc\">NoOpTransactionsFake</span> <span class=\"kd\">implements</span> <span class=\"nc\">Transactions</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n\n    <span class=\"nd\">@Override</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"no\">T</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"no\">T</span> <span class=\"nf\">execute</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"nc\">Supplier</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"no\">T</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">operation</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">operation</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">get</span><span class=\"o\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-flavours-of-the-onion-or-how-to-represent-layers-in-code\">The Flavours of The Onion or how to represent layers in code?</h2>\n\n<p>There are two basic approaches to representing the layers in the code. The one that we used in our most recent\nproject was to use a package naming convention.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-13-onion-architecture/onion-packages.png\" alt=\"onion packages\" /></p>\n\n<p>Every domain package has three subpackages: domain, application and infrastructure. This method is clear, easy to\nunderstand and navigate, and does not require changes to the build tool setup. The downside is that, except for the\nagreed convention, and Code Review process to check them, there is no mechanism preventing you from using a class\ndefined in the application layer in the domain layer, thus breaking the direction of the dependencies. One can always\nuse such tools as <a href=\"https://www.archunit.org/\">ArchUnit</a> to write tests checking if there are no “prohibited” imports,\nbut in my opinion, we can do better by employing build tool modules support.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"build-tools-to-the-rescue\">Build tools to the rescue</h3>\n\n<p>The more involved approach is to define compilation modules representing the layers. Its disadvantage is a more\ncomplicated build structure and setup of your build tool of choice. On the other side though, having the compiler on\nyour side is very helpful, and prevents the above-mentioned issue. The direction of the dependencies between layers is\nclearly defined in the module build files.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-groovy highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// settings.gradle</span>\n<span class=\"n\">rootProject</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"na\">name</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">'onion'</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">include</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'domain'</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'application'</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"s1\">'infrastructure'</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Using Gradle setup as an example, one can define three modules — domain, application, and infrastructure —\nin <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">settings.gradle</code> file. Then, in the build files corresponding to each of the modules, declare their dependencies,\nclearly defining the direction of dependencies.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-groovy highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// /application/build.gradle</span>\n<span class=\"n\">dependencies</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">implementation</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">project</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">':domain'</span><span class=\"o\">))</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// /infrastructure/build.gradle</span>\n<span class=\"n\">plugins</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">id</span> <span class=\"s1\">'org.springframework.boot'</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">id</span> <span class=\"s1\">'io.spring.dependency-management'</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">id</span> <span class=\"s1\">'com.revolut.jooq-docker'</span> <span class=\"n\">version</span> <span class=\"s1\">'0.3.7'</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">dependencies</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">implementation</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">project</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">':domain'</span><span class=\"o\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">implementation</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">project</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">':application'</span><span class=\"o\">))</span>\n\n    <span class=\"n\">implementation</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">implementation</span><span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-jooq'</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"c1\">// other dependencies and settings removed for brevity</span>\n<span class=\"o\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Notice, that the biggest file is the one for the infrastructure layer. It should not be a surprise by now. The\ninfrastructure has all the framework — in this case Spring Boot — database driver, and other dependencies, and itself\ndepends on both domain and application. There’s of course nothing preventing you from declaring extra dependencies,\nsay Lombok. The most important thing to note here is that with this build setup, it will not be possible to reverse the\norder of dependencies between the layers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>Problems Onion Architecture solves</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A more structured, layered layout of the code makes code navigation easier and makes the relationship between\ndifferent parts of the codebase more visible at first glance</li>\n  <li>Loose coupling between the domain and the infrastructure</li>\n  <li>Coupling is towards the centre of The Onion — expressed by the relationship between the layers</li>\n  <li>(Usually) No coupling between the domain and the infrastructure concerns of the application</li>\n  <li>Build tool support in enforcing layers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Problems Onion Architecture creates</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Additional learning curve for new developers, and those used to other architecture styles</li>\n  <li>Increased overall complexity of the codebase — especially with the flavour utilising the modularizing capabilities of build tools such as Gradle or Maven</li>\n  <li>Not everyone likes the smell of it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As mentioned above at the beginning of the article, Onion Architecture is not a one-size-fits-all solution.

This makes it a bad choice, for more\ntechnical-oriented services, e.g. a high-throughput proxy written in a reactive framework.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"footnotes\">Footnotes</h3>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>The typical, “classic” enterprise architecture, usually consists of three layers: the presentation layer, the domain layer and the persistence (data) layer. The dependency direction goes top-down, and in the strict approach a layer sees only its nearest neighbour. The clear advantage is the separation of concerns, and the reduction of the scope of responsibilities of each layer. There are two issues though — that architecture style often leads to a so-called <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html\">anemic domain model</a>, since most of the business logic is placed in service classes, because, and that’s the second issue, domain classes depend on the persistence layer — and often become only data carriers without behaviour. For a comparison of different software architecture styles, see <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-patterns/9781491971437/\">Software Architecture Patterns</a> (e-book, pdf) <a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>The number of layers may differ.

This article discusses one of the backend application\narchitecture styles which proved to be successful in providing a good foundation for building and maintaining an\napplication in the long run: Onion Architecture.\nOnion Architecture\nOnion Architecture is a software architectural style which strongly promotes the separation of concerns between the most\nimportant part of a business application — the domain code — and its technical aspects like HTTP or database. It does so\nwith ideas similar to Hexagonal Architecture,\nClean Architecture and\nother related architecture styles.\nThis post gives a description of the ideas of Onion Architecture and discusses a sample implementation which explicitly\ndefines layers in the code and build setup.\nAdditional complexity to the build setup and extra learning curve introduced by the layered approach pays back during\ndevelopment. It reduces the cognitive load on the programmer by giving a more concrete structural foundation and guidance.\nThe Repository\nThe code samples are taken from an example repository, which you can find\non GitHub.\nWhy does Software Architecture matter?\nDuring my Engineering career, I’ve worked on multiple projects using different architectural styles. From a happy-go-lucky\napproach without any obvious structure, through “classic”1 three-tier enterprise style, to highly structured\narchitecture, reflected by the setup of the build tool and supported by the compiler.\nThe experience of working on those projects was also very different. Having to introduce a change in a shapeless blob of\nspaghetti code was always a painful experience, connected with stressful moments of Have I broken something? Or Oh\nno! A gazillion of unrelated tests broke…\nOn the other hand, working in a more rigid, but at the same time more expressive, and structured environment of\na well-architected application, was a breeze and a real pleasure. Not to mention that the time required to introduce the\nchange was smaller, and the estimates were more precise and predictable.\nGood architecture guides the implementation makes it easy to introduce new changes, and — to some degree — prevents\nless experienced team members from making doubtful decisions. It allows developers to focus on the value-providing\nimplementation rather than thinking Hmm where should I put this class?.\nLast but not least, software architecture is often defined as the things that are hard to change, so choosing a proper\narchitectural approach to your new application is of key importance to its future development and maintenance.\nAbout the Onion\nThe idea of Onion Architecture, first introduced by Jeffrey Palermo in\na series of articles, is similar to other clean\narchitecture approaches presented in Robert “Uncle Bob” Martin’s\nblog post, his book\nClean Architecture, and\nquite recently on our blog. It can be successfully used as an alternative to a\npopular Hexagonal / Ports and Adapters architecture, and as such is predominantly used in the backend, business\napplications and services.\nThe core concept in all the above styles is the same — to make the domain the most central part of the application, and\nremove all infrastructure concerns, such as talking via HTTP, messaging, database mapping, testing, etc., away from the\ndomain code. The core of the business logic should be free (in theory at least) from any of the technical, and\nframework-related problems, allowing for easy testing and rapid development.\nTo put it using Uncle Bob’s words: Though these architectures all vary somewhat in their details, they are very\nsimilar. They all have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns. They all achieve this separation by\ndividing the software into layers. Each has at least one layer for business rules, and another for interfaces.\nThe main difference I’ve found in the implementations of Hexagonal Architecture and Onion Architecture lies mostly in\nthe overall, more structured approach to the code layout of the latter. Both styles rely on the conscious usage of\ninterfaces, and the Dependency Inversion Principle, which is the layer and encapsulation, but the Onion, like a real vegetable, has explicitly defined layers. Making the concept a\nfirst-class citizen represented in the code guides implementation and gives more clear overall structure to the\ncodebase.\nThis Architecture style does have some learning curve for developers in the project, but once mastered, pays back many\ntimes. Finally, as with every solution in the IT industry, it is not a one-size-fits-all, and you should always consider\nif the architectural style matches your needs.\nThe Onion has Layers\nOnion Architecture is a form of layered architecture. The main difference between “the classic” three-tier architecture\nand the Onion, is that every outer layer sees classes from all inner layers, not only the one directly below. Moreover,\nthe dependency direction always goes from the outside to the inside, never the other way around.\nBut wait, what are the layers of Onion Architecture, what do they describe, and why do they matter?\nThere are three2 main layers in Onion Architecture:\nThe domain layer\nThe application layer\nThe infrastructure layer\neach of which has its responsibilities.\n\nThe Domain Layer\nThis is the layer where you place classes describing the core of your business.\nLet’s use a simple example. An application written to help manage a Library would most probably have classes like Book,\nReader, Copy and so on. The classes, relations and interactions between them describe the core of the domain of the\napplication, i.e. what business needs it fulfils and in what way. In the Library, there would be a process of adding new\ntitles to the catalogue, a process of borrowing and returning copies of a book, charging readers for overdue books, and\nmany more.\nA sample domain class could look like the one below:\n\n\n@ToString\n@EqualsAndHashCode(of = \"id\")\n@AllArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PRIVATE)\nabstract sealed class Book {\n\n    protected final BookId id;\n    protected final Version version;\n    protected final AuthorId author;\n    protected final Title title;\n    protected final CreatedAt createdAt;\n    protected final ApprovedAt approvedAt;\n    protected final RejectedAt rejectedAt;\n    protected final ArchivedAt archivedAt;\n\n    // static factory method for assembling a new instance of a Book — hides the internal representation\n    static Book create(AuthorId author, Title title, CreatedAt createdAt) {\n        return new NewBook(BookId.next(), Version.first(), author, title, createdAt);\n    }\n\n    // One of the subclasses representing the current state of the book entity\n    // Other subclasses omitted for brevity.\n    private static final class NewBook extends Book {\n\n        private NewBook(BookId id, Version version, AuthorId author, Title title, CreatedAt createdAt) {\n            super(id, version, author, title, createdAt, null, null, null);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        protected BookSnapshot.Status status() {\n            return BookSnapshot.Status.AWAITING_APPROVAL;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        Book approve(ApprovedAt approvedAt) {\n            return new ApprovedBook(id, version, author, title, createdAt, approvedAt);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        Book reject(RejectedAt rejectedAt) {\n            return new RejectedBook(id, version, author, title, createdAt, rejectedAt);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Available domain operations\n    Book approve(ApprovedAt approvedAt) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Unsupported state transition. Cannot approve book in state [%s]\"\n                .formatted(status()));\n    }\n\n    Book reject(RejectedAt rejectedAt) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Unsupported state transition. Cannot reject book in state [%s]\"\n                .formatted(status()));\n    }\n\n    Book archive(ArchivedAt archivedAt) {\n        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\n                \"Unsupported state transition. Cannot archive book in state [%s]\".formatted(status())\n        );\n    }\n} \n\n\nSince the domain changes the most — here is the place where you put all the new features, and business requirements — it\nshould be as easy as possible to modify and test. Thus, it should not be concerned which database is used in the\nproject, nor should it know which communication style, synchronous RPC calls, asynchronous messaging, or a mix of is\nused to trigger the logic or maybe that it’s triggered by unit tests and not real user interactions. This doesn’t mean\nof course, that the domain classes can’t have any dependencies. Like it the example above — the code uses Lombok\nannotations, generating the boilerplate which otherwise needs to be written by the programmer.\nThe Application Layer\nThis is the layer where you place your classes, which describe the use cases of the application and coordinate the work\nof the domain classes. For example, we can imagine that a new title added to the library undergoes an approval process:\nthe book is fetched from the repository, a timestamp of approval is generated, the book state (only new books can be\napproved) is checked, and if it’s OK, a modified book is then saved using the repository.\nThe code describing such a use case can look like this:\n\nclass Books {\n    // other fields and methods omitted   \n    public BookSnapshot approve(BookId id) {\n        return transactions.execute(() -> {\n            final Book book = bookRepository.getById(id);\n            final ApprovedAt approvedAt = new ApprovedAt(timeMachine.now());\n            final Book approved = book.approve(approvedAt);\n            return bookRepository.update(approved).snapshot();\n        });\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nThis is also the layer that “knows” which operations should be performed atomically, thus the transaction-related code\nis placed here. Note, however, that in the example above, the transactions field is actually an interface reference.\n\n\n@FunctionalInterface\npublic interface Transactions {\n\n    <T> T execute(Supplier<T> operation);\n}\n\n\nThe application uses the behaviour expressed by the interface, the details of how the behaviour is executed lie in the\ninfrastructure layer.\nThe Infrastructure Layer\nThis layer, the outermost layer of Onion, is a place where all framework and technology related stuff goes. It tends to\nbe the most “thick” since it contains the implementations of the interfaces defined in the inner layers. Need an\nHTTP controller, a message listener or a database adapter (an implementation of repository interface defined at the domain layer)? Infrastructure is the place to go.\nThe domain, although the most important part of the application, tends to be also the smallest in terms of code size.\nThe reverse is true about the infrastructure code — all the supporting mechanisms, which are placed at the\ninfrastructure layer, are the backbone which animates the domain behaviour, and as such that part of the service should\nnot be neglected.\nStaying with the example of the Transactions interface, let’s take a look at possible implementations. A simple approach\nusing Spring’s programmatic transaction handling could look like this:\n\n\n@Component\n@AllArgsConstructor\nclass JdbcTransactions implements Transactions {\n\n    private final TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate;\n\n    @Override\n    public <T> T execute(Supplier<T> operation) {\n        return transactionTemplate.execute(status -> operation.get());\n    }\n}\n\n\nand for unit test, one can set up a fake, noop implementation:\n\nclass NoOpTransactionsFake implements Transactions {\n\n    @Override\n    <T> T execute(Supplier<T> operation) {\n        operation.get()\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe Flavours of The Onion or how to represent layers in code?\nThere are two basic approaches to representing the layers in the code. The one that we used in our most recent\nproject was to use a package naming convention.\n\nEvery domain package has three subpackages: domain, application and infrastructure. This method is clear, easy to\nunderstand and navigate, and does not require changes to the build tool setup. The downside is that, except for the\nagreed convention, and Code Review process to check them, there is no mechanism preventing you from using a class\ndefined in the application layer in the domain layer, thus breaking the direction of the dependencies. One can always\nuse such tools as ArchUnit to write tests checking if there are no “prohibited” imports,\nbut in my opinion, we can do better by employing build tool modules support.\nBuild tools to the rescue\nThe more involved approach is to define compilation modules representing the layers. Its disadvantage is a more\ncomplicated build structure and setup of your build tool of choice. On the other side though, having the compiler on\nyour side is very helpful, and prevents the above-mentioned issue. The direction of the dependencies between layers is\nclearly defined in the module build files.\n\n// settings.gradle\nrootProject.name = 'onion'\n\ninclude('domain', 'application', 'infrastructure')\n\n\nUsing Gradle setup as an example, one can define three modules — domain, application, and infrastructure —\nin settings.gradle file. Then, in the build files corresponding to each of the modules, declare their dependencies,\nclearly defining the direction of dependencies.\n\n// /application/build.gradle\ndependencies {\n    implementation(project(':domain'))\n}\n// /infrastructure/build.gradle\nplugins {\n    id 'org.springframework.boot'\n    id 'io.spring.dependency-management'\n    id 'com.revolut.jooq-docker' version '0.3.7'\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation(project(':domain'))\n    implementation(project(':application'))\n\n    implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web')\n    implementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-jooq')\n\n    // other dependencies and settings removed for brevity\n}\n\n\nNotice, that the biggest file is the one for the infrastructure layer. It should not be a surprise by now. The\ninfrastructure has all the framework — in this case Spring Boot — database driver, and other dependencies, and itself\ndepends on both domain and application. There’s of course nothing preventing you from declaring extra dependencies,\nsay Lombok. The most important thing to note here is that with this build setup, it will not be possible to reverse the\norder of dependencies between the layers.\nFinal Thoughts\nProblems Onion Architecture solves\nA more structured, layered layout of the code makes code navigation easier and makes the relationship between\ndifferent parts of the codebase more visible at first glance\nLoose coupling between the domain and the infrastructure\nCoupling is towards the centre of The Onion — expressed by the relationship between the layers\n(Usually) No coupling between the domain and the infrastructure concerns of the application\nBuild tool support in enforcing layers\nProblems Onion Architecture creates\nAdditional learning curve for new developers, and those used to other architecture styles\nIncreased overall complexity of the codebase — especially with the flavour utilising the modularizing capabilities of build tools such as Gradle or Maven\nNot everyone likes the smell of it\nAs mentioned above at the beginning of the article, Onion Architecture is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It has its\nlearning curve and is best suited for services with a clear domain definition. This makes it a bad choice, for more\ntechnical-oriented services, e.g. a high-throughput proxy written in a reactive framework.\nFootnotes\nThe typical, “classic” enterprise architecture, usually consists of three layers: the presentation layer, the domain layer and the persistence (data) layer. The dependency direction goes top-down, and in the strict approach a layer sees only its nearest neighbour. The clear advantage is the separation of concerns, and the reduction of the scope of responsibilities of each layer. There are two issues though — that architecture style often leads to a so-called anemic domain model, since most of the business logic is placed in service classes, because, and that’s the second issue, domain classes depend on the persistence layer — and often become only data carriers without behaviour. For a comparison of different software architecture styles, see Software Architecture Patterns (e-book, pdf) ↩\nThe number of layers may differ. The three-tier division is usually called Simplified Onion Architecture. Another possible rendition of the division is to have five layers with a separate Repository layer above the domain and a service layer above the repositories. I find that division to be a step towards over-engineering and found that the 3-layered approach strikes the best balance. ↩","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/02/onion-architecture.html","categories":["tech","architecture","software","engineering"],"isoDate":"2023-02-12T23:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"},{"title":"How we solved a mobile application performance issue with a few lines of code?","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/01/lazy-loading-with-mbox.html","pubDate":"Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0100","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Łukasz Solniczek"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/lukasz.solniczek.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/lukasz.solniczek"]}]},"content":"<p>Sometimes great results in code performance come with a small amount of work.\nWe’d like to tell you a story about how we changed the <a href=\"/about-us/\">Allegro</a> mobile homepage\nand reduced usage of Allegro service infrastructure with only a few lines of code.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h3>\n\n<p>The story is about the homepage in the Allegro app on <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.allegro\">Android</a>\nand <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/allegro/id305659772\">iOS</a>, the first screen a user sees when opening the app.\nOriginally it was a long screen with a lot of content rendered with data from tens of, sometimes costly, data sources (services we use to prepare data for our frontend).</p>\n\n<p>A lot was happening there.</p>\n\n<p>It was not a big problem earlier but became one when the number of users of our applications started growing, after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWithin one year, the number of requests sent to our infrastructure from the Allegro homepage increased almost 3 times, consequently becoming a performance issue.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-01-25-lazy-loading-with-mbox/lazy-loading-rps.png\" alt=\"Lazy Loading Homepage\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-idea\">The idea</h3>\n\n<p>We decided to split the homepage content into two parts.

However, the way they work differs greatly from the tried and true world of SQL.</p>\n\n<p>In databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL there are transactions based on tables and relations with isolation levels such as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">READ_UNCOMMITED</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">READ_COMMITED</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">REPEATABLE_READ</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">SERIALIZABLE</code>. These help us to recognize if the record we’re working on is dirty, both when we want to access it or when someone else wants to do it after we’ve made some changes. In the world of documents, shards and replicas, the changes made to a single document are already atomic by design.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we need transactions then? I only talked about single documents, but after all, documents can be modified in bulk, and these operations are no longer atomic.</p>\n\n<p>That’s why transactions were introduced into MongoDB. In this blog post, we will check how they work and what their use cases are.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-transaction\">What is a transaction?</h3>\n\n<p>A database transaction is a unit of work, designed to handle the changes of data in the database. It makes sure that the output of the data is consistent and doesn’t generate errors. It helps with concurrent changes to the database, and makes the database more scalable.</p>\n\n<p>By definition, database transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. Sounds familiar? Exactly, it’s <strong>ACID</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"does-mongodb-implement-acid\">Does MongoDB implement ACID?</h3>\n\n<p>Before implementing transactions? Not really. Of course, there are some properties of ACID that are present (as stated earlier), but before version 4.0 they were impossible to achieve in a distributed ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an excerpt from the MongoDB website: <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/basics/acid-transactions\">we estimate that 80%-90% of applications that leverage the document model will not need to utilize transactions in MongoDB</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Alas, when you need to make changes to multiple documents, or worse, if they are split across multiple shards, then there is no guarantee that the changes will adhere to ACID properties. That’s why the need for ACID transactions arose.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, since version 4.0 transactions were added to MongoDB, first for multi-document changes, and then, in 4.2, for distributed data.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"specifics-of-mongodb-transactions\">Specifics of MongoDB transactions</h3>\n\n<p>Having in mind the differences between MongoDB and SQL DB engines, we need to first take a look at how transactions in Mongo are specified. Since the problems that arise from having multiple documents, replica sets and shards differ from the issues of concurrent access to a table row, resolutions to these problems are also different in nature.</p>\n\n<p>The transaction in MongoDB is denoted by two properties: <strong>ReadConcern</strong> and <strong>WriteConcern</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>A <strong>ReadConcern</strong> property is used to control the consistency and isolation of the data we read from the database.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the <strong>WriteConcern</strong> property is us defining when we consider the data we write to be consistent in the database.</p>\n\n<p>(Side note: when we are talking about majority we are talking about calculated majority. You can read more about it in <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/write-concern/#std-label-calculating-majority-count\">Calculating majority count</a>)</p>\n\n<p>We distinguish between three levels of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">ReadConcern</code> for transactions (others are unavailable to use in this case):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>local, which reads the latest data from a node that has been queried. There are no guarantees that the data read is the most recent across the system,</li>\n  <li>majority, which reads the data at the point of majority-commit. Said point is calculated by the primary node. This ReadConcern doesn’t guarantee consistency unless WriteConcern of at least majority is also stated,</li>\n  <li>snapshot, which reads from a snapshot of majority-commited data. This ReadConcern level is mainly only available in transactions (so we can’t use it in single-document reads save for some outliers) and provides its benefits mainly with sharded transactions as it guarantees that the data is synchronized across shards</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As we can see, we can draw some parallels between MongoDB’s ReadConcern options and the SQL world, where local would be equal to READ UNCOMMITED, majority would be similar to REPEATABLE READ and snapshot has near likeness to SERIALIZABLE.</p>\n\n<p>What about WriteConcerns? There are three main descriptors:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>1, which basically means that we are only interested in primary node committing the changes. Unfortunately, using this WriteConcern means that you will have no guarantees for any of the ReadConcerns stated above,</li>\n  <li>Any {number} greater than 1 states that we want to get the data committed by the primary and {number - 1} of secondary nodes. This WriteConcern depends on the number of nodes in the system, since it can denote more than the majority of the nodes and in this case would provide us with read guarantees,</li>\n  <li>majority, which means that majority of nodes acknowledge the changes in data. This WriteConcern provides us with read guarantees, and also gives us benefits of eventual consistency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"enough-theory-i-want-to-see-it-in-action\">Enough theory, I want to see it in action!</h3>\n\n<p>For this example I’m using <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/\">MongoDB community edition 6.0 for macOS</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve created a MongoDB server consisting of one config database and one shard replica set with three members.

However, the way they work differs greatly from the tried and true world of SQL.\nIn databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL there are transactions based on tables and relations with isolation levels such as READ_UNCOMMITED, READ_COMMITED, REPEATABLE_READ and SERIALIZABLE. These help us to recognize if the record we’re working on is dirty, both when we want to access it or when someone else wants to do it after we’ve made some changes. In the world of documents, shards and replicas, the changes made to a single document are already atomic by design.\nWhy do we need transactions then? I only talked about single documents, but after all, documents can be modified in bulk, and these operations are no longer atomic.\nThat’s why transactions were introduced into MongoDB. In this blog post, we will check how they work and what their use cases are.\nWhat is a transaction?\nA database transaction is a unit of work, designed to handle the changes of data in the database. It makes sure that the output of the data is consistent and doesn’t generate errors. It helps with concurrent changes to the database, and makes the database more scalable.\nBy definition, database transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated and durable. Sounds familiar? Exactly, it’s ACID.\nDoes MongoDB implement ACID?\nBefore implementing transactions? Not really. Of course, there are some properties of ACID that are present (as stated earlier), but before version 4.0 they were impossible to achieve in a distributed ecosystem.\nHere’s an excerpt from the MongoDB website: we estimate that 80%-90% of applications that leverage the document model will not need to utilize transactions in MongoDB.\nAlas, when you need to make changes to multiple documents, or worse, if they are split across multiple shards, then there is no guarantee that the changes will adhere to ACID properties. That’s why the need for ACID transactions arose.\nFortunately, since version 4.0 transactions were added to MongoDB, first for multi-document changes, and then, in 4.2, for distributed data.\nSpecifics of MongoDB transactions\nHaving in mind the differences between MongoDB and SQL DB engines, we need to first take a look at how transactions in Mongo are specified. Since the problems that arise from having multiple documents, replica sets and shards differ from the issues of concurrent access to a table row, resolutions to these problems are also different in nature.\nThe transaction in MongoDB is denoted by two properties: ReadConcern and WriteConcern.\nA ReadConcern property is used to control the consistency and isolation of the data we read from the database.\nSimilarly, the WriteConcern property is us defining when we consider the data we write to be consistent in the database.\n(Side note: when we are talking about majority we are talking about calculated majority. You can read more about it in Calculating majority count)\nWe distinguish between three levels of ReadConcern for transactions (others are unavailable to use in this case):\nlocal, which reads the latest data from a node that has been queried. There are no guarantees that the data read is the most recent across the system,\nmajority, which reads the data at the point of majority-commit. Said point is calculated by the primary node. This ReadConcern doesn’t guarantee consistency unless WriteConcern of at least majority is also stated,\nsnapshot, which reads from a snapshot of majority-commited data. This ReadConcern level is mainly only available in transactions (so we can’t use it in single-document reads save for some outliers) and provides its benefits mainly with sharded transactions as it guarantees that the data is synchronized across shards\nAs we can see, we can draw some parallels between MongoDB’s ReadConcern options and the SQL world, where local would be equal to READ UNCOMMITED, majority would be similar to REPEATABLE READ and snapshot has near likeness to SERIALIZABLE.\nWhat about WriteConcerns? There are three main descriptors:\n1, which basically means that we are only interested in primary node committing the changes. Unfortunately, using this WriteConcern means that you will have no guarantees for any of the ReadConcerns stated above,\nAny {number} greater than 1 states that we want to get the data committed by the primary and {number - 1} of secondary nodes. This WriteConcern depends on the number of nodes in the system, since it can denote more than the majority of the nodes and in this case would provide us with read guarantees,\nmajority, which means that majority of nodes acknowledge the changes in data. This WriteConcern provides us with read guarantees, and also gives us benefits of eventual consistency.\nEnough theory, I want to see it in action!\nFor this example I’m using MongoDB community edition 6.0 for macOS.\nI’ve created a MongoDB server consisting of one config database and one shard replica set with three members. You can find the steps in the official MongoDB documentation.\nTo start, we need some data that’s already present in the database, so that we can see the changes that are being made. First, let’s connect to one of our nodes in a replica set:\nmongosh --host localhost --port 27027\nThen, let’s insert the following data:\n\ndb.blog.insertMany([\n    {\n    \"title\": \"GC, hands off my data!\",\n    \"author\": \"Allegro Blogperson\",\n    \"date\": ISODate(\"2022-06-30\"),\n    \"url\": \"https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/06/gc-hands-off-my-data.html\"\n    },\n    {\n    \"title\": \"How to facilitate EventStorming workshops\",\n    \"author\": \"Blog Stormer\",\n    \"date\": ISODate(\"2022-07-19\"),\n    \"url\": \"https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/07/event-storming-workshops.html\"\n    },\n    {\n    \"title\": \"MBox: server-driven UI for mobile apps\",\n    \"author\": \"Mobile Guru\",\n    \"date\": ISODate(\"2022-08-03\"),\n    \"url\": \"https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/08/mbox-server-driven-ui-for-mobile-apps.html\"\n    }\n])\n\n\nLet’s also connect to a different node in our replica set:\nmongosh --host localhost --port 27028\nWe can verify here that the data is present:\n\ndb.blog.find()\n\n\nThis should return all our data that we inserted earlier.\n\n[\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6311eebd6effda71326b35d3\"),\n    title: 'MBox: server-driven UI for mobile apps',\n    author: 'Mobile Guru',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-08-03\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/08/mbox-server-driven-ui-for-mobile-apps.html'\n    },\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6311eebd6effda71326b35d2\"),\n    title: 'How to facilitate EventStorming workshops',\n    author: 'Blog Stormer',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-07-19\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/07/event-storming-workshops.html'\n    },\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6311eebd6effda71326b35d1\"),\n    title: 'GC, hands off my data!',\n    author: 'Allegro Blogperson',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-06-30\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/06/gc-hands-off-my-data.html'\n    }\n]\n\n\nTime to add some data in a transaction. To do that, we first need to establish a transaction using the following command (in the first shell):\nvar session = db.getMongo().startSession()\nAfter we start the session, it’s time to open the transaction:\nsession.startTransaction({\"readConcern\": {\"level\": \"snapshot\"}, \"writeConcern\": {\"w\": \"majority\"}})\nThen, to make sure that we are using our collection in the context of a session, we need to run this:\nvar blog = session.getDatabase('test').getCollection('blog');\nWe can now insert new data into our collection while transaction is active:\n\nblog.insertOne({\n        \"title\": \"Transactions in MongoDB\",\n        \"author\": \"Piotr Kisielewicz\",\n        \"date\": ISODate(\"2022-11-30\"),\n        \"url\": \"https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/11/transactions-in-mongodb.html\"\n    })\n\n\n\n{acknowledged: true, insertedId: ObjectId(\"6319e60accc51dfa32ca495a\")}\n\n\nBefore committing our transaction, let’s try to read the data from another replica (in the second shell which we opened previously):\n\ndb.blog.find()\n[\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6311eebd6effda71326b35d3\"),\n    title: 'MBox: server-driven UI for mobile apps',\n    author: 'Mobile Guru',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-08-03\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/08/mbox-server-driven-ui-for-mobile-apps.html'\n    },\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6311eebd6effda71326b35d2\"),\n    title: 'How to facilitate EventStorming workshops',\n    author: 'Blog Stormer',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-07-19\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/07/event-storming-workshops.html'\n    },\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6311eebd6effda71326b35d1\"),\n    title: 'GC, hands off my data!',\n    author: 'Allegro Blogperson',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-06-30\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/06/gc-hands-off-my-data.html'\n    }\n]\n\n\nAs you can see, the new record is nowhere to be found. Let’s now commit the transaction (in the first shell):\n\nsession.commitTransaction();\n{\n    readOnly: false,\n    ok: 1,\n    lastCommittedOpTime: Timestamp({ t: 1662641697, i: 1 }),\n    '$clusterTime': {\n        clusterTime: Timestamp({ t: 1662641697, i: 1 }),\n        signature: {\n            hash: Binary(Buffer.from(\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\", \"hex\"), 0),\n            keyId: 0\n        }\n    },\n    operationTime: Timestamp({ t: 1662641697, i: 1 })\n}\n\n\nAnd now, let’s run the same query (in the second shell):\n\ndb.blog.find()\n[\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6311eebd6effda71326b35d3\"),\n    title: 'MBox: server-driven UI for mobile apps',\n    author: 'Mobile Guru',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-08-03\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/08/mbox-server-driven-ui-for-mobile-apps.html'\n    },\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6311eebd6effda71326b35d2\"),\n    title: 'How to facilitate EventStorming workshops',\n    author: 'Blog Stormer',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-07-19\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/07/event-storming-workshops.html'\n    },\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6311eebd6effda71326b35d1\"),\n    title: 'GC, hands off my data!',\n    author: 'Allegro Blogperson',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-06-30\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/06/gc-hands-off-my-data.html'\n    },\n    {\n    _id: ObjectId(\"6319e60accc51dfa32ca495a\"),\n    title: 'Transactions in MongoDB',\n    author: 'Piotr Kisielewicz',\n    date: ISODate(\"2022-09-30\"),\n    url: 'https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/09/transactions-in-mongodb.html'\n    }\n]\n\n\nSuccess! The data is now present after the commit, and we could see it being absent before committing the change.\nIt was all in CLI, is there support for transactions in code?\nYeah, the drivers are already there! For example, if you are using Spring, the only thing you need to do to get MongoDB transaction support is to annotate your methods with @Transactional.\nIf you’re using specific driver libraries, e.g. mongo-java-driver, then here’s a code snippet for you:\n\nval client = new MongoClient(uri)\nval db = client.getDatabase(\"blog\")\nval blogCollection = db.getCollection(\"blogPost\", BlogPost::class.java)\nval session = client.startSession()\ntry {\n    session.startTransaction(TransactionOptions.builder().writeConcern(WriteConcern.MAJORITY).build())\n    blogCollection.insertOne(session, BlogPost())\n    session.commitTransaction()\n} catch (e: MongoCommandException) {\n    session.abortTransaction()\n} finally {\n    session.close()\n}\n\n\nDo we use MongoDB transactions at Allegro?\nNot yet. We are evaluating transactions internally and are checking whether they would fit our use cases.\nFurther reading\nACID transactions in MongoDB\nMongoDB transactions\nRead concern\nWrite concern\nspring-data-mongodb\nmongo-java-driver","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/12/transactions-in-mongodb.html","categories":["tech","techradar","NoSQL"],"isoDate":"2022-12-20T23:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"}],"jobs":[{"id":"743999891783831","name":"Software Engineer Python","uuid":"b049a619-1c77-41de-8058-dcd6989a0032","jobAdId":"c2b85537-24b3-499a-9747-8c3362acb384","refNumber":"REF4017Z","company":{"identifier":"Allegro","name":"Allegro"},"releasedDate":"2023-03-09T10:07:19.043Z","location":{"city":"Warszawa, Poznań, Kraków, Toruń, Wrocław, Lublin, Gdańsk, Katowice, Łódź","region":"","country":"pl","remote":false},"industry":{"id":"internet","label":"Internet"},"department":{"id":"2572770","label":"IT - Software Development"},"function":{"id":"information_technology","label":"Information Technology"},"typeOfEmployment":{"id":"permanent","label":"Full-time"},"experienceLevel":{"id":"mid_senior_level","label":"Mid-Senior Level"},"customField":[{"fieldId":"60cb31a9c87e511299a3a050","fieldLabel":"Department II","valueId":"faf591d7-af03-4d05-b67e-dba247924756","valueLabel":"IT - Other"},{"fieldId":"58c15608e4b01d4b19ddf790","fieldLabel":"Recruitment Process","valueId":"ed4682c7-33c9-41c2-8d13-428ed39046f5","valueLabel":"Tech.
