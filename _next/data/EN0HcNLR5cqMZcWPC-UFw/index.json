Join us as we demystify WCAG, explore its latest 2.2 version, and gaze into the future of digital\ninclusivity. Get ready for a journey that’s as enlightening as it is entertaining!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-exactly-is-wcag\">What exactly is WCAG?</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine you are opening a bar and want to invite all your friends there, and you want them to have a great time hanging out at your place. But some of your\nfriends have different disabilities, such as using wheelchairs or having trouble seeing or hearing. You want everyone to have fun, right? Well, WCAG which stands for\nWeb Contents Accessibility Guidelines, is set of rules to make sure Internet is like a bar that everyone can enjoy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"four-principles-of-accessibility\">Four principles of accessibility</h2>\n\n<p>The guidelines and Success Criteria are based on four key principles that provide the fundamental basis for anyone to access and use web content. Let me explain\nthem as simply as possible:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Perceivable (big text and clear pictures)</strong> - everything on a website should be easy to see and understand. Imagine reading a book. Some people need big\nletters, and some might not see well. So, WCAG says websites should have big letters and clear pictures, like a book with large print and colorful\nillustrations,</li>\n  <li><strong>Operable (easy to click and move)</strong> - the user interface and navigation of a website are easy to operate. It means that people should be able to interact\nwith the content using various methods, such as a keyboard or assistive technologies like screen readers. It also encourages predictable and consistent\nnavigation and input methods,</li>\n  <li><strong>Understandable (no confusing stuff)</strong> - ever been on a website and got lost because it was too complicated? WCAG says websites should be like a\nstraightforward treasure hunt, not a confusing maze. They should have clear instructions and be easy to understand, just like a fun treasure hunt game with\nsimple clues,</li>\n  <li><strong>Robust (works everywhere)</strong> - robustness means that websites should be built to last and work well with different technologies. This ensures that websites\nremain accessible as technology evolves. It’s like building a house with strong foundations so that it stands the test of time.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In essence, WCAG is like a set of rules and recommendations to make the Internet a welcoming and usable place for everyone, regardless of their abilities or\ndisabilities. It’s about creating a digital world that is inclusive and user-friendly for all.</p>\n\n<p>WCAG guidelines are organized into three levels of conformance:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>A - addressing the most critical issues to ensure a minimal level of accessibility</li>\n  <li>AA - covers a broader range of requirements; the website is more accessible and user-friendly</li>\n  <li>AAA - ensures the highest level of accessibility</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"timeline\">Timeline</h2>\n\n<p>I don’t want to bore you with details, but I think it is good to understand that WCAG is not something new. It’s been around for quite a while!</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>1997 - W3C started working on WCAG 1.0</li>\n  <li>1999 - WCAG 1.0 shipped</li>\n  <li>2001-2007 - WCAG 2.0</li>\n  <li>2017-2018 - WCAG 2.1</li>\n  <li>2020 - W3C started working on WCAG 2.2</li>\n  <li>2023 - WCAG 2.2</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"wcag-22\">WCAG 2.2</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/\">The new version</a> introduces 9 new success criteria (SC) - two at level A, four at level AA, and three at AAA. Let’s give them a closer look.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2411-a--2412-aa---stop-hiding-my-focus\">2.4.11 (A) &amp; 2.4.12 (AA) - “Stop hiding my focus!”</h3>\n\n<p>I think we can all agree here - it is just annoying if you are browsing the web and all of a sudden something appears - a modal, cookie banner, chat\nwidget, and covers what we were just reading.</p>\n\n<p>So make sure the focus is not obscured. It also applies to submenus and sticky headers.</p>\n\n<p>For A and AA levels focused user interface component should be at least partially visible; for AAA it must be fully visible.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"257-aa---aaargh-i-cant-do-this-drag--drop-thing-i-need-another-way-to-do-this\">2.5.7 (AA) - “Aaargh! I can’t do this drag &amp; drop thing! I need another way to do this..!”</h3>\n\n<p>If a feature on a website or app can be used by moving your cursor or finger in a dragging motion (like when you click and drag a slider), it should also be\npossible to use that feature without dragging.</p>\n\n<p>This helps people with mobility difficulties, especially when it might be difficult for them to press and hold down and precisely control their movement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"258-aa---i-need-these-buttons-to-be-big-enough-that-im-sure-i-will-press-the-right-one\">2.5.8 (AA) - “I need these buttons to be big enough that I’m sure I will press the right one”</h3>\n\n<p>The size of the target for pointer inputs should be at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels.</p>\n\n<p>This comes along with criterion 2.5.5 introduced in WCAG 2.1 (<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/target-size.html\">minimum target size</a>) - this is still valid, but it’s AAA level.</p>\n\n<p>Buttons that are too small or too close to each other are a common problem for people with mobility issues. It’s difficult to interact with the right one. This\nrule is not the same as the AAA success rule, which says that things you click on need to be big enough to easily click on. This rule is about making sure that\nthings you click on are either naturally big enough or spaced far enough apart from other things, so you don’t accidentally click on the wrong thing. The worst\nthing here that can happen is that you accidentally submit something you didn’t want to!</p>\n\n<p>How about links that are stacked on top of each other or small images adjacent to each other? How can we make them fulfill SC 2.5.8?</p>\n\n<p>Let’s use an imaginary 24px diameter circle. If you draw this circle in the center of your link - if that imaginary circle doesn’t intersect another target or\nanother imaginary circle from a small target, then the link is sufficiently spaced.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2024-01-24-wcag-2-2/imaginary-circles.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"small-image\" /></p>\n\n<p>Just as many other success criteria, there are exceptions, and the most important for us are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>links in text,</li>\n  <li>user-agent controls - as we do not always control what the browser provides. Common examples are select elements (checkboxes, date pickers, etc.); note, that\nthis rule does apply to these structures if you are building them by yourself,</li>\n  <li>essential elements - when things just have to be close to each other; an example of this is a map.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"2413-aaa---wh-where-is-my-keyboard-focus-\">2.4.13 (AAA) - “Wh… Where is my keyboard focus..? :(”</h2>\n\n<p>Although it is AAA level, it was hoped and tried to have the success criterion at AA.</p>\n\n<p>Focus helps people who rely on keyboard navigation - not only people who are using some assistive technologies but also power users (curb-cut effect again!). The\nfocus indicator must be visible, with good contrast and size:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>contrast ratio must be at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states,</li>\n  <li>size needs to be at least the area of a 2px thick perimeter on the unfocused components.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The following 4 criteria are meant to improve <strong>cognitive accessibility</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"326-a---i-need-help-but-i-have-no-idea-how-to-find-it\">3.2.6 (A) - “I need help but I have no idea how to find it!”</h2>\n\n<p>This criterion does not require that help be provided. But if it is - it should be easy to find and its placement should be consistent among multiple screens\n(for example: always in the same place in the footer). The help section location may change as the viewport size changes, but it must be consistent across pages at the\nsame viewport size.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"337-a---ive-just-told-you-that-why-do-i-have-to-repeat-myself\">3.3.7 (A) - “I’ve just told you that, why do I have to repeat myself?”</h2>\n\n<p>Do not require people to enter the same information more than once during a process.

Possibly due to the lack of suitable alternatives, although not using the cache is a huge trade-off.\nThankfully, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/getifyX/status/1720810762409566459\">there are some voices of reason</a> in the community.</p>\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://allegro.tech/\">Allegro</a>, we’ve been using SVG and CSS filters for quite some time.\nHowever, they have their limits and could be better suited for the challenges of the themeable design system.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s pause for a moment and rethink the approach to icons.\nIt has to meet several requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>themeable,</li>\n  <li>cacheable,</li>\n  <li>easily embeddable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"can-we-do-better-than-weve-been-doing-so-far\">Can we do better than we’ve been doing so far?</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2024-01-10-embed-multicolor-icons-using-a-single-DOM-element/icon.webp\" alt=\"Multilayer icon\" title=\"Multilayer icon\" /></p>\n\n<p>All the tools needed to perform the trick have been available in major browsers for at least few years.\nIs it possible everyone just failed to connect the dots?\nIt turns out that the platform is capable of dealing with icons more efficiently.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Let us introduce the SVG+CSS technique.

Possibly due to the lack of suitable alternatives, although not using the cache is a huge trade-off.\nThankfully, there are some voices of reason in the community.\nAt Allegro, we’ve been using SVG and CSS filters for quite some time.\nHowever, they have their limits and could be better suited for the challenges of the themeable design system.\nLet’s pause for a moment and rethink the approach to icons.\nIt has to meet several requirements:\nthemeable,\ncacheable,\neasily embeddable.\nCan we do better than we’ve been doing so far?\n\nAll the tools needed to perform the trick have been available in major browsers for at least few years.\nIs it possible everyone just failed to connect the dots?\nIt turns out that the platform is capable of dealing with icons more efficiently.\nLet us introduce the SVG+CSS technique. It lets you have a 3-color icon using just one DOM element and one external SVG.\nWe have found nothing similar, whether online or with ChatGPT, which makes us want to share this idea with you even more.\nConsider the proposed technique if you care about performance.\nKey benefits are:\nCaching.\nWorks cross-domain.\nCustomizable more than a single color.\nIcons load after critical resources and content, not bloating the markup.\nWe will control the colors of 3 different parts with a single DOM element and SVG resource.\nSounds interesting? Then, let’s dive into how we can accomplish this.\nImplementation\nSVG and CSS are gifts that keep giving and can do wonders combined.\nThe proposed technique is a combination of two platform capabilities.\nSVG Fragments\nCSS Masks\nSVG Fragments aren’t really a new technology.\nAbout five years ago, we considered using CSS masks, but we still supported IE back then.\nAt that time, we had not yet thought of combining it with fragments.\nAs a case study let’s pick one of our icons —\n.\nWith the following source:\n\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\" fill=\"none\" height=\"32\" width=\"32\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <path d=\"...\" fill=\"#B0B8BC\"></path>\n  <path clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"...\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" fill=\"#FF7B33\"></path>\n  <path d=\"...\" fill=\"#D9DFE4\"></path>\n</svg>\n\n\nThis particular icon consists of 3 parts, each with a different color.\nNow, we’re going to control these colors with the document’s CSS.\nIt’s time to program in SVG and CSS for a moment.\nStep #1 — SVG Fragments\nFirst, let’s craft our test subject and introduce the fragments.\nEach path gets a unique Fragment Identifier by setting an id attribute.\nNext, we add a little CSS to enable rendering fragments in isolation. Think of it as an image sprite.\nFor the sake of CSS simplicity, we also group all the paths under an extra g element with a unique id.\nAs a result, the SVG is supposed to look like this:\n\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\" fill=\"none\" height=\"32\" width=\"32\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <style>\n    path:not(:target) {\n      display: none;\n    }\n    g:target path {\n      display: inline;\n    }\n  </style>\n  <g id=\"icon\">\n    <path id=\"border\" d=\"...\" fill=\"#B0B8BC\"></path>\n    <path id=\"a\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"...\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\" fill=\"#FF7B33\"></path>\n    <path id=\"shadow\" d=\"...\" fill=\"#D9DFE4\"></path>\n  </g>\n</svg>\n\n\nIt produces 4 fragments, one for each of the three paths and the last for the whole icon. Each of them can now be rendered as a separate image:\n#a — \n#border — \n#shadow — \n#icon — \nNow, the regular fragment-less URL will display a blank image.\nThus, for the full icon, we’re going to add a #icon fragment to the URL.\nWe won’t use the #a fragment, but let’s keep its identifier.\nStep #2 — CSS Masks\nWith SVG Fragment Identifiers up and ready, we can use CSS Masks.\nThe base class .icon stacks three layers on top of each other, ready for a mask.\n\n.icon {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 32px;\n  height: 32px;\n  mask-repeat: no-repeat;\n  background-color: currentColor;\n}\n.icon::before,\n.icon::after {\n  content: '';\n  position: absolute;\n  width: inherit;\n  height: inherit;\n  background-color: inherit;\n}\n\n\nThe last CSS class is for our specific icon.\n\n.icon--a {\n  mask-image: url('./a.svg#icon'); /* full icon’s shape */\n  color: #FF7B33;\n}\n.icon--a::before {\n  mask-image: url('./a.svg#shadow'); /* shadow’s shape */\n  color: #D9DFE4;\n}\n.icon--a::after {\n  mask-image: url('./a.svg#border'); /* border’s shape */\n  color: #B0B8BC;\n}\n\n\nThe critical part is that we picked the whole icon, not any fragment, as the parent’s mask, so we have the entire icon visible.\nThat’s because the parent layer masks its children.\nWe selected the orange color of the a for the parent layer.\nThen, we put the two remaining layers on top of it.\nThe second and third layers are for shadow and border parts, respectively.\nWe can describe this as the whole icon in single color covered by one or more shapes in different colors.\nWhen an icon has intersecting parts, there’s one thing to keep in mind.\nBackgrounds render on top of each other in a particular order:\nthe parent’s background,\nthe ::before pseudo-element’s background,\nthe ::after’s background at the end.\nAs a result, we can embed the icon by a single element.\n\n<div class=\"icon icon--a\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></div>\n\n\nLet’s also consider accessibility.\nUsually, icons are purely decorative content.\nThat’s why we remove them from the accessibility tree by aria-hidden=\"true\".\nThe result is supposed to look like the original icon from the start —\n.\nNow, the single element gives us control over up to three parts of our icon.\nMoreover, we can change colors independently and dynamically.\nThe demo\nFeel free to check the demo.\nPretty neat.\nWe found this technique practical, and we’re keen to use it in the future.\nMore colors\nIf you need more than 3 colors, switch from pseudo-elements to regular elements. Then, you can stack as many layers as you want.\nAnother option is to combine background-image with gradients instead of background-color.\nEnjoy & use the platform ❤️","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2024/01/embed-multicolor-icons-using-a-single-DOM-element.html","categories":["tech","web","svg","css","html"],"isoDate":"2024-01-09T23:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"},{"title":"Clever, surprised and gray-haired","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/12/lmdb-postmortem.html","pubDate":"Thu, 14 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0100","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Tomasz Ziółkowski"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/tomasz.ziolkowski.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/tomasz.ziolkowski"]}]},"content":"<p>This article is a form of a public postmortem in which we would like to share our bumpy way of revealing the cause of a mysterious performance problem.\nBesides unveiling part of our technical stack based on open-source solutions, we also show how some false assumptions made such a bug triage process much\nharder.\nBesides all NOT TO DOs, you can find some exciting information about performance hunting and reproducing performance issues on a small scale.\nAs a perk, we prepared a <a href=\"https://github.com/ziollek/lmdb-modsecurity-perf-issue\">repository</a> where you can reproduce the problem and make yourself familiar with tools\nthat allowed us to confirm the cause.\nThe last part (lessons learned) is the most valuable if you prefer to learn from the mistakes of others.</p>\n\n<p>Before you start reading, I must warn you that it will be a pretty long story, and following it without technical knowledge will be challenging.\nHowever, I tried my best to simplify the technicalities as much as possible.

Such an approach is not very useful in connection with HTTP servers that utilize\nmultiprocessing as <em>nginx</em> does.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/nginx-in-memory.png\" alt=\"In-memory approach\" /></p>\n\n<p>However, we learned that <em>ModSecurity</em> can use <a href=\"http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/\">LMDB</a> as an internal fast storage for contextual information that could be\nshared between requests that come, for example, from the same IP address. <em>LMDB</em> approach ensures that contextual information stored by one nginx worker process\nis accessible by others.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/nginx-with-lmdb.png\" alt=\"LMDB approach\" /></p>\n\n<p>At first glance, it looks great; however, in our case, we could not rely on information that is stored directly by <em>ModSecurity</em>.\nAs you can imagine, our setup is based on more than one server, so we have to be able to pass the same contextual information to each of them.\nMoreover, our algorithms that compute such information are complex and reach for more data than those available to ModSecurity.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, <em>LMDB</em> has one great advantage: it allows connecting to it from outside the <em>nginx</em> process and altering the contextual data that is available to\n<em>ModSecurity</em>.\nWe built a mechanism that syncs contextual information from dedicated service to LMDB on each transparent proxy host.\nA simplified view of the architecture that allows computing and synchronizing contextual information is depicted below (dotted lines represent asynchronous flow):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/nginx-architecture.png\" alt=\"Final architecture\" /></p>\n\n<p>Such a PoC gave us promising results regarding how fast the contextual information could be provided and how fast it was retrieved by <em>ModSecurity</em>.\nFinally, we rolled out the new approach, and everything worked smoothly for such a long time that we assumed it was a rock-solid solution.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"surprised-once-upon-a-time-the-problem-occurred-for-the-first-time\">Surprised: once upon a time, the problem occurred for the first time</h2>\n\n<p>We noticed that response time from the client’s perspective soared, and the number of established connections also increased.\nSuch a correlation is not strange and was noticed many times in the past when the upstream that handles requests from proxy started responding slower.\nWhat was mysterious in that case was that there was no evidence of a problem on the upstream side besides the metric from <em>nginx</em> that was based on\n<em>$upstream_connect_time</em>.\nAccording to that metric, connecting to the upstream had slowed down significantly.</p>\n\n<p>Having such <em>a clue</em> we blamed the part of infrastructure that is always to blame if no one knows what is happening.\nAs you probably guessed, we assumed that was a temporary network issue (from my experience, it is the best justification to not dig more profound).\nUnfortunately, <em>the network issue</em> started occurring quite often, at least a few times a week.\nStrangely enough, if we disable the transparent proxy, the network seems to be stable. Once again, we were convinced that someone from the network team devised blameless culture.\nHence, we started to verify a lot of new hypotheses, from those scary (cyber war, specialized attacks that are hidden in regular traffic) to those that bring\nsmiles upon our faces at least for today (backdoor left by <em>Russian spy</em> in the nginx source code).\nFalsification of those hypotheses that were at least partially backed up by data is a great story about how to teach engineers that correlation does not mean\ncausation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"turn-gray-investigation\">Turn gray: investigation</h2>\n\n<p>Let me introduce a simplified view of our infrastructure to show where we gathered data.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/proxy-chain.png\" alt=\"Proxy chain\" /></p>\n\n<p>All proxies measure at least the total processing time, including the time consumed in the proxy and the time that was consumed outside the proxy (passing the\nrequest to the next server in the above chain and waiting for the response).\nAnd those parts could be analyzed independently. Based on such measurements, we can simply compute the approximate overhead of the proxy as a difference between the whole\nrequest (green box) processing and the upstream (red box) waiting.\nHaving that, we were able to discover that the time consumed in transparent proxy was not increased significantly; only the time consumed outside of proxy was\nraised (red box).\nIt was one of the big lies that hindered revealing the truth. You can find a broader explanation of misleading metrics in the lessons learned part.\nAfter excluding network issues, and upstream issues, we were pretty sure that the problem lay in transparent proxy, and we started to doubt what we saw in\nmetrics.\nIt took a while, but finally, we were able to break our unwavering trust in data. Relying on data is encoded in our company DNA, so trusting it was a natural\ninstinct, unfortunately, a bad one in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Having that, we could not rely on metrics provided by a transparent proxy. We were starting to try out other means to measure what was going on inside the\ntransparent proxy.\nBeing biased by network issues, we started gathering a lot of network-related information that only showed correlations with problems, but it did not give any\nclues about what was happening.</p>\n\n<p>It was a time to use the more straightforward but quite heavy solution - access logs. However, logs are not very useful in giving the overall condition of the proxy;\nthey can be beneficial in analyzing singular problems.\nWhen the problems occurred again, we had some data that we could scrutinize. It turned out that an excellent idea was to log exact timestamps in\na very high resolution (which was not default).\nBelow, you can see a real example reproduced in the local environment (which will be described later).\nEach line contains nginx worker process id, timestamp, request_time, upstream_request_time, upstream_connect_time and the response status code.</p>\n<pre>\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:<b>8.990</b> urt:<b>8.990</b> uct:<b>7.128</b> status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:12.348 urt:12.348 uct:3.358 status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:<b>8.990</b> urt:<b>8.990</b> uct:<b>7.128</b> status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:<b>8.990</b> urt:<b>8.990</b> uct:<b>7.128</b> status:200\n</pre>\n\n<p>It turned out that very often information was logged in bursts with exactly the same timestamp, what was even more intriguing was that some of such entries\nreported the exact same time as an <em>$upstream_request_time</em> or <em>$upstream_connect_time</em>.\nLet’s say that even if you are keen on paranormal mystery, odds, that’s the moment when the big red light should start blinking.\nIt definitely looks like something deterministic, not random. In the production realm, it was even more interesting; some bursts were connected with each other\nin some strange arithmetic way - for example:</p>\n\n<p>Let’s define bursts as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>B1, B2, B3 - bursts</p>\n\n  <p>B1.TS - timestamp of the burst</p>\n\n  <p>B3.urt, B3.uct - upstream_request_time, upstream_connect_time - reported during last burst</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>then such relation was often noticed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>B1.TS + B3.uct = B2.TS</p>\n\n  <p>B1.TS + B3.urt = B3.TS</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To better understand such a relation, let’s draw it:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/bursts-relationship.png\" alt=\"Bursts relation\" /></p>\n\n<p>Having a clue that there are extended periods of time when processing for a particular process is stuck, we wanted to know what was going on when processes hung.\nWe used strace to preview what particular system calls were made during such problems. The challenge was to connect to the process when problems occur,\nbut fortunately for us (and less fortunately for our users) we did not wait a long time for the subsequent instability, and we were able to gather strace data.\nIt reveals a large number of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futex\">futex</a> calls that indicated active waiting for some barer / mutex.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"connecting-the-dots\">Connecting the dots</h2>\n\n<p>As it was announced earlier, on that stage we have three actors. In order to better understand what was happening under the hood, let’s take a closer look at\neach of them.</p>\n\n<p>First of all <em>nginx</em> server, it uses\n<a href=\"https://www.nginx.com/blog/inside-nginx-how-we-designed-for-performance-scale/\">an asynchronous event-driven approach to handling connections</a>.\nIt means that a single <em>nginx</em> worker can process a large number of requests simultaneously basically because a significant part of processing a single request\nhappens outside the worker. Instead of actively waiting for a response, the nginx process uses such spare time to handle new incoming requests.\nEverything works very efficiently as long as each blocking (IO consuming) operation is handled in an asynchronous manner\n(the control is returned to event-loop).\nWhen such a requirement is unmet, the processing pace slows dramatically.</p>\n\n<p>The second actor is the ModSecurity-nginx plugin. <em>Nginx</em> plugins allow extending the logic of the server by adding custom logic.\nModSecurity-nginx plugin allows inspecting requests processed by nginx against <em>ModSecurity</em> rules.\nSuch inspection can be considered a CPU-bound operation, so even if it is called in a synchronous manner, it does not break the concept of processing\nblocking operations asynchronously.</p>\n\n<p>The third one is <em>LMDB</em>, a very efficient mapped DB that allows <strong>concurrent reads and exclusive writes</strong>. This database was used as a storage for ModSecurity\ncollections in order to share a state of collections between nginx workers.\nThe documentation and source code of this relatively small project were scrutinized many times as well as integration between ModSecurity and <em>LMDB</em>, but there\nwas no suspicion of what could be wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, it turned out that the version of <em>ModSecurity</em> that we scrutinized was from the master branch. Moreover, the master branch contained an improvement related to misusing\n<em>LMDB</em> exclusive transactions while reading the data. Given that, we had a justified belief that issues came from exclusive transactions. It means that\nnginx workers probably block on acquiring locks.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-12-14-lmdb-postmortem/locking.png\" alt=\"Exclusive locking\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reproducing-the-issue-in-the-isolated-environment\">Reproducing the issue in the isolated environment</h2>\n\n<p>To reproduce the issue, we decided to use a technique that we called a fancy name: <em>exaggeration</em>.\nReproducing a problem that occurs under high traffic that is handled by powerful servers is not simple on a local workstation.\nHowever, in this case, we had some clues and justified hypotheses about what could be wrong and what part we should focus on.\nLet me explain what exaggeration means when it comes to reproducing a problem.\nSome sort of problems can be easily noticeable when the probability of the occurrence of rare events is raised to a significant level.\nIf we have different ways to increase such probability, we can use them interchangeably. I am aware that it sounds like theoretical physics, but believe me or\nnot our problems are relatively easier to solve than those worked on by the guys at LHC.</p>\n\n<p>In our case, we were pretty sure that the number of concurrent lookups on a single server to <em>ModSecurity</em> collections is a rare event.\nSo instead of loading a local server in enormous traffic we significantly increased the number of lookups to <em>LMDB</em> that were performed for each processed\nrequest.</p>\n\n<p>All below information is based on data that can be gathered from the docker\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ziollek/lmdb-modsecurity-perf-issue#what-does-the-environment-consist-of\">environment</a> that was prepared as an integral part of this article.\nIt is worth mentioning that the environment can be built in one of two modes:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>regular that is way faster when it comes to building process</li>\n  <li>profiling that allows revealing the exact point where nginx processes hang based on profiling information from the kernel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I would not like to deep dive into the profiling process based on kernel capabilities, but it is very cumbersome in a containerized environment because\nit breaks the isolation paradigm.\nMoreover, it is hard to prepare due to compatibility requirements between host and container libraries, header files and compilers.\nHowever, for this particular purpose it was tempting to use limited profiling tools based on <a href=\"https://ebpf.io/\">eBPF</a> that do not have such restricted\nrequirements.</p>\n\n<p>The first part of the reproducing process is feeding <em>LMDB</em> collections\nwith <a href=\"https://github.com/ziollek/lmdb-modsecurity-perf-issue#preparing-sample-data\">sample data</a>.\nWhen the collections are prepared, we can run <a href=\"https://github.com/ziollek/lmdb-modsecurity-perf-issue#testing-performance\">performance tests using ab</a>.\nBy increasing the number of lookups against <em>LMDB</em> collections during each request, it is relatively simple to reproduce low performance.\nAnalysis of access logs revealed the bursts mentioned in investigation part.</p>\n\n<p>The more interesting part was finding the exact place that caused hangs. We started from the entry point (for call inspection of the request headers) to\n<em>ModSecurity</em> from the nginx plugin, namely <strong>msc_process_request_headers</strong> function.\nWe helped ourselves with a tool <a href=\"https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/bpfcc-tools/trace-bpfcc.8.en.html\">trace-bpfcc</a> provided within package <strong>bpfcc-tools</strong>.\nBesides all other features, that tool allows logging the exact point in time when a particular function is called and when it is finished.\nWhen we analyzed the time spent on such a function, we realized that was the exact place where we should dig deeper:</p>\n\n<pre>\ntrace-bpfcc -t  'p:/usr/local/modsecurity/lib/libmodsecurity.so.3.0.6:msc_process_request_headers \"start\"' \\\n  'r:/usr/local/modsecurity/lib/libmodsecurity.so.3.0.6:msc_process_request_headers \"stop\"' \\\n  'r:/usr/local/modsecurity/lib/libmodsecurity.so.3.0.6:msc_process_logging \"stop\"' 2&gt;/dev/null\n\nTIME     PID     TID     COMM            FUNC             -\n..\n<b>3.981139 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start</b>\n6.296459 10847   10847   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.297111 10847   10847   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.309465 10844   10844   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.310118 10844   10844   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n<b>6.314868 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop</b>\n6.319024 10840   10840   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.323392 10839   10839   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.328587 10837   10837   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.332937 10843   10843   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.338358 10841   10841   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.339536 10841   10841   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.349181 10845   10845   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.367007 10838   10838   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.368100 10838   10838   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n<b>6.522875 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_logging stop</b>\n...\n</pre>\n\n<p>Please pay attention to highlighted lines related to PID=10842.\nIt turned out that the upstream responded within the required time (in the prepared environment, we are able to control the upstream latency by part of the URL path):\n6.522875 - 6.314868 ~ 200ms.\nHowever, the rest of time: <em>6.314868 - 3.981139 ~ 2.230s</em> is consumed in <strong>msc_process_request_headers</strong>, when we search for the access log entry related to\nthis processing we can see:</p>\n\n<pre>\nconnection:5824 timestamp:1700222187.657 request_time:2.440 upstream_response_time:2.439 upstream_connect_time:<b>2.235</b> upstream_header_time:<b>2.438</b> status:200 request:(GET /users/200/random?arg=unknown HTTP/1.0)\n</pre>\n\n<p>I would not bore you with the whole process of tracking down but go directly to the <em>LMDB</em> <strong>mdb_txn_begin</strong> function that starts the <em>LMDB</em> transaction.\nThat function is called for each <em>LMDB</em> lookup, so there are way more calls than in previous profiling.\nHowever, I prepared a command that allows us to aggregate all time consumed while waiting in that function.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code># trace-bpfcc -t 'p:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblmdb.so.0.0.0:mdb_txn_begin \"start\"' \\\n  'r:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblmdb.so.0.0.0:mdb_txn_begin \"stop\"' 2&gt;/dev/null | tee /tmp/benchmark.log\n# cat /tmp/benchmark.log  | sort -n | awk '{if ($6 == \"start\") { data[$2] = $1} else { summary += 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]); print $1, $2, 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]) }} END {print \"Total time spent on locking: \", summary, \"ms,  number of calls: \", calls}'\n...\nTotal time spent on locking: 105891ms number of calls:  4064\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>As a comparison, we can execute the same profiling on version with a fix.

It turned out that part of <em>ModSecurity</em> processing was included into upstream time,\nso the red part on above diagram also includes <em>ModSecurity</em> processing that is not part of establishing connection. As a form of self-punishment,\nwe <a href=\"https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity-nginx/pull/278\">extended</a> the <em>nginx-ModSecurity</em> plugin in such a way that it allows measuring the overhead of\neach <em>ModSecurity</em> phase in a reliable way.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"log-timestamps\">Log timestamps</h3>\n\n<p>It may seem redundant because many logger collectors by default add their own timestamp of the moment when log entries are received in the collector.\nHowever, having a timestamp from <strong>the moment when the log is produced</strong> (without any delays) is crucial to reveal suspicious patterns/hangs on the producer\nside that can not be observed if timestamps are affected by random lags.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"do-not-abuse-undocumented-behavior\">Do (not) abuse undocumented behavior</h3>\n\n<p>One of the reasons that we faced this issue was abusing usage of <em>ModSecurity</em> collections.\nIn regular and <a href=\"https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v3.x%29#user-content-Persistent_Storage\">documented</a> usage such collections\nare considered to be simple key-value storage.\nWe discovered that under each key, we are able to store a list of values instead of a single value. If you consciously scanned the provided repository\n(especially <em>ModSecurity</em> rules) you could probably find a way to simulate a situation where multiple values are fetched while reading a single key.\nLet’s look at a rule that is available in the repository</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>SecRule &amp;REQUEST_HEADERS:x-set-sample \"@eq 1\" \"phase:1,setvar:global.sample%{REQUEST_HEADERS:x-set-sample}=%{REQUEST_HEADERS:x-set-sample},log,deny,status:403,id:50,msg:'value of sample header is blocked',tag:'priority:1',tag:'action:deny'\"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If we call above rule with x-set-sample header with subsequent values <em>1, 2, 3</em>. We can do that by making HTTP requests as below:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>workstation # docker-compose exec nginx-before-fix bash\nnginx-with-lmdb # curl -I -H'x-set-sample: 1' localhost\nnginx-with-lmdb # curl -I -H'x-set-sample: 2' localhost\nnginx-with-lmdb # curl -I -H'x-set-sample: 3' localhost\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then, we can expect that there will be stored three key-value pairs:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>globals[sample1]=1</li>\n  <li>globals[sample2]=2</li>\n  <li>globals[sample3]=3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Indeed, when we try to read <em>LMDB</em> in a very naive approach, values are stored the way we expect. We can see something like that:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>nginx-with-lmdb # strings /tmp/modsec-shared-collections\nsample::::sample11\nsample::::sample22\nsample::::sample33\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The following rule that is interesting is supposed to check if a value under a particular key is equal to a query param.\nBasically, if the request contains query parameter <strong>arg=1</strong>, then we check if the value in the collection <strong>global</strong>, under the key <strong>sample</strong> is also “1”.\nIf the condition is met then the request will be blocked, which means that <strong>403</strong> status code will be returned.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>SecRule ARGS_GET \".*\" \"chain,phase:1,log,capture,deny,status:403,id:1001,msg:'value of param %{TX.0} is blocked',setvar:tx.param=%{TX.0}\"\n    SecRule global.sample \"@streq %{tx.param}\" \"t:none\"\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>You may be confused why we are reading the key <strong>sample</strong> that was never set.\nLet’s look what happens when we try to make a request with value 1 and -1.\nAs I described earlier, our intention was to check if <strong>global[sample] == 1</strong>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>nginx-with-lmdb  # curl -I \"http://localhost/users/200/random?arg=1\"\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nServer: nginx/1.22.0 (Ubuntu)\nDate: Fri, 17 Nov 2023 10:58:39 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 162\nConnection: keep-alive\nnginx-with-lmdb\n\nnginx-with-lmdb  # curl -I \"http://localhost/users/200/random?arg=-1\"\nHTTP/1.1 200\nServer: nginx/1.22.0 (Ubuntu)\nDate: Fri, 17 Nov 2023 10:58:42 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 79\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Quite interesting? It turns out that the match is fulfilled for value “1”, and surprisingly there is a log that gives us an insight:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>nginx-with-lmdb  # tail -5 /var/log/nginx/modsec_audit.log\n---TL9qTmAS---H--\nModSecurity: Access denied with code 403 (phase 1).

If, despite all discouragement, you are interested in solving technical mysteries,\ntake a sip of coffee and enjoy the story!\nClever: what have we built?\nA few years ago, we researched several platforms that can be used as transparent HTTP proxies capable of handling HTTP traffic to our services.\nWe needed a solution that would be able to inspect metadata and user data against any suspicious patterns and decide if such traffic should be processed or banned.\nWe chose nginx in concert with ModSecurity as a foundation for a more complex\necosystem.\nDuring increasing usage of such a stack, more than simple non-contextual rules was needed for more complex traffic analysis. One of the most crucial needs was providing the ability to store some contextual information connected\nwith session activity in order to better recognize malicious patterns.\nBy default, ModSecurity allows storing contextual information in memory. Such an approach is not very useful in connection with HTTP servers that utilize\nmultiprocessing as nginx does.\n\nHowever, we learned that ModSecurity can use LMDB as an internal fast storage for contextual information that could be\nshared between requests that come, for example, from the same IP address. LMDB approach ensures that contextual information stored by one nginx worker process\nis accessible by others.\n\nAt first glance, it looks great; however, in our case, we could not rely on information that is stored directly by ModSecurity.\nAs you can imagine, our setup is based on more than one server, so we have to be able to pass the same contextual information to each of them.\nMoreover, our algorithms that compute such information are complex and reach for more data than those available to ModSecurity.\nNevertheless, LMDB has one great advantage: it allows connecting to it from outside the nginx process and altering the contextual data that is available to\nModSecurity.\nWe built a mechanism that syncs contextual information from dedicated service to LMDB on each transparent proxy host.\nA simplified view of the architecture that allows computing and synchronizing contextual information is depicted below (dotted lines represent asynchronous flow):\n\nSuch a PoC gave us promising results regarding how fast the contextual information could be provided and how fast it was retrieved by ModSecurity.\nFinally, we rolled out the new approach, and everything worked smoothly for such a long time that we assumed it was a rock-solid solution.\nSurprised: once upon a time, the problem occurred for the first time\nWe noticed that response time from the client’s perspective soared, and the number of established connections also increased.\nSuch a correlation is not strange and was noticed many times in the past when the upstream that handles requests from proxy started responding slower.\nWhat was mysterious in that case was that there was no evidence of a problem on the upstream side besides the metric from nginx that was based on\n$upstream_connect_time.\nAccording to that metric, connecting to the upstream had slowed down significantly.\nHaving such a clue we blamed the part of infrastructure that is always to blame if no one knows what is happening.\nAs you probably guessed, we assumed that was a temporary network issue (from my experience, it is the best justification to not dig more profound).\nUnfortunately, the network issue started occurring quite often, at least a few times a week.\nStrangely enough, if we disable the transparent proxy, the network seems to be stable. Once again, we were convinced that someone from the network team devised blameless culture.\nHence, we started to verify a lot of new hypotheses, from those scary (cyber war, specialized attacks that are hidden in regular traffic) to those that bring\nsmiles upon our faces at least for today (backdoor left by Russian spy in the nginx source code).\nFalsification of those hypotheses that were at least partially backed up by data is a great story about how to teach engineers that correlation does not mean\ncausation.\nTurn gray: investigation\nLet me introduce a simplified view of our infrastructure to show where we gathered data.\n\nAll proxies measure at least the total processing time, including the time consumed in the proxy and the time that was consumed outside the proxy (passing the\nrequest to the next server in the above chain and waiting for the response).\nAnd those parts could be analyzed independently. Based on such measurements, we can simply compute the approximate overhead of the proxy as a difference between the whole\nrequest (green box) processing and the upstream (red box) waiting.\nHaving that, we were able to discover that the time consumed in transparent proxy was not increased significantly; only the time consumed outside of proxy was\nraised (red box).\nIt was one of the big lies that hindered revealing the truth. You can find a broader explanation of misleading metrics in the lessons learned part.\nAfter excluding network issues, and upstream issues, we were pretty sure that the problem lay in transparent proxy, and we started to doubt what we saw in\nmetrics.\nIt took a while, but finally, we were able to break our unwavering trust in data. Relying on data is encoded in our company DNA, so trusting it was a natural\ninstinct, unfortunately, a bad one in this case.\nHaving that, we could not rely on metrics provided by a transparent proxy. We were starting to try out other means to measure what was going on inside the\ntransparent proxy.\nBeing biased by network issues, we started gathering a lot of network-related information that only showed correlations with problems, but it did not give any\nclues about what was happening.\nIt was a time to use the more straightforward but quite heavy solution - access logs. However, logs are not very useful in giving the overall condition of the proxy;\nthey can be beneficial in analyzing singular problems.\nWhen the problems occurred again, we had some data that we could scrutinize. It turned out that an excellent idea was to log exact timestamps in\na very high resolution (which was not default).\nBelow, you can see a real example reproduced in the local environment (which will be described later).\nEach line contains nginx worker process id, timestamp, request_time, upstream_request_time, upstream_connect_time and the response status code.\n8.990 urt:8.990 uct:7.128 status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:12.348 urt:12.348 uct:3.358 status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:8.990 urt:8.990 uct:7.128 status:200\npid:41 t:1700163031.929 rt:8.990 urt:8.990 uct:7.128 status:200\n\n\nIt turned out that very often information was logged in bursts with exactly the same timestamp, what was even more intriguing was that some of such entries\nreported the exact same time as an $upstream_request_time or $upstream_connect_time.\nLet’s say that even if you are keen on paranormal mystery, odds, that’s the moment when the big red light should start blinking.\nIt definitely looks like something deterministic, not random. In the production realm, it was even more interesting; some bursts were connected with each other\nin some strange arithmetic way - for example:\nLet’s define bursts as:\nB1, B2, B3 - bursts\nB1.TS - timestamp of the burst\nB3.urt, B3.uct - upstream_request_time, upstream_connect_time - reported during last burst\nthen such relation was often noticed:\nB1.TS + B3.uct = B2.TS\nB1.TS + B3.urt = B3.TS\nTo better understand such a relation, let’s draw it:\n\nHaving a clue that there are extended periods of time when processing for a particular process is stuck, we wanted to know what was going on when processes hung.\nWe used strace to preview what particular system calls were made during such problems. The challenge was to connect to the process when problems occur,\nbut fortunately for us (and less fortunately for our users) we did not wait a long time for the subsequent instability, and we were able to gather strace data.\nIt reveals a large number of futex calls that indicated active waiting for some barer / mutex.\nConnecting the dots\nAs it was announced earlier, on that stage we have three actors. In order to better understand what was happening under the hood, let’s take a closer look at\neach of them.\nFirst of all nginx server, it uses\nan asynchronous event-driven approach to handling connections.\nIt means that a single nginx worker can process a large number of requests simultaneously basically because a significant part of processing a single request\nhappens outside the worker. Instead of actively waiting for a response, the nginx process uses such spare time to handle new incoming requests.\nEverything works very efficiently as long as each blocking (IO consuming) operation is handled in an asynchronous manner\n(the control is returned to event-loop).\nWhen such a requirement is unmet, the processing pace slows dramatically.\nThe second actor is the ModSecurity-nginx plugin. Nginx plugins allow extending the logic of the server by adding custom logic.\nModSecurity-nginx plugin allows inspecting requests processed by nginx against ModSecurity rules.\nSuch inspection can be considered a CPU-bound operation, so even if it is called in a synchronous manner, it does not break the concept of processing\nblocking operations asynchronously.\nThe third one is LMDB, a very efficient mapped DB that allows concurrent reads and exclusive writes. This database was used as a storage for ModSecurity\ncollections in order to share a state of collections between nginx workers.\nThe documentation and source code of this relatively small project were scrutinized many times as well as integration between ModSecurity and LMDB, but there\nwas no suspicion of what could be wrong.\nFinally, it turned out that the version of ModSecurity that we scrutinized was from the master branch. Moreover, the master branch contained an improvement related to misusing\nLMDB exclusive transactions while reading the data. Given that, we had a justified belief that issues came from exclusive transactions. It means that\nnginx workers probably block on acquiring locks.\n\nReproducing the issue in the isolated environment\nTo reproduce the issue, we decided to use a technique that we called a fancy name: exaggeration.\nReproducing a problem that occurs under high traffic that is handled by powerful servers is not simple on a local workstation.\nHowever, in this case, we had some clues and justified hypotheses about what could be wrong and what part we should focus on.\nLet me explain what exaggeration means when it comes to reproducing a problem.\nSome sort of problems can be easily noticeable when the probability of the occurrence of rare events is raised to a significant level.\nIf we have different ways to increase such probability, we can use them interchangeably. I am aware that it sounds like theoretical physics, but believe me or\nnot our problems are relatively easier to solve than those worked on by the guys at LHC.\nIn our case, we were pretty sure that the number of concurrent lookups on a single server to ModSecurity collections is a rare event.\nSo instead of loading a local server in enormous traffic we significantly increased the number of lookups to LMDB that were performed for each processed\nrequest.\nAll below information is based on data that can be gathered from the docker\nenvironment that was prepared as an integral part of this article.\nIt is worth mentioning that the environment can be built in one of two modes:\nregular that is way faster when it comes to building process\nprofiling that allows revealing the exact point where nginx processes hang based on profiling information from the kernel\nI would not like to deep dive into the profiling process based on kernel capabilities, but it is very cumbersome in a containerized environment because\nit breaks the isolation paradigm.\nMoreover, it is hard to prepare due to compatibility requirements between host and container libraries, header files and compilers.\nHowever, for this particular purpose it was tempting to use limited profiling tools based on eBPF that do not have such restricted\nrequirements.\nThe first part of the reproducing process is feeding LMDB collections\nwith sample data.\nWhen the collections are prepared, we can run performance tests using ab.\nBy increasing the number of lookups against LMDB collections during each request, it is relatively simple to reproduce low performance.\nAnalysis of access logs revealed the bursts mentioned in investigation part.\nThe more interesting part was finding the exact place that caused hangs. We started from the entry point (for call inspection of the request headers) to\nModSecurity from the nginx plugin, namely msc_process_request_headers function.\nWe helped ourselves with a tool trace-bpfcc provided within package bpfcc-tools.\nBesides all other features, that tool allows logging the exact point in time when a particular function is called and when it is finished.\nWhen we analyzed the time spent on such a function, we realized that was the exact place where we should dig deeper:\n3.981139 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.296459 10847   10847   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.297111 10847   10847   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.309465 10844   10844   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.310118 10844   10844   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.314868 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.319024 10840   10840   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.323392 10839   10839   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.328587 10837   10837   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.332937 10843   10843   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.338358 10841   10841   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.339536 10841   10841   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.349181 10845   10845   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.367007 10838   10838   nginx           msc_process_request_headers stop\n6.368100 10838   10838   nginx           msc_process_request_headers start\n6.522875 10842   10842   nginx           msc_process_logging stop\n...\n\n\nPlease pay attention to highlighted lines related to PID=10842.\nIt turned out that the upstream responded within the required time (in the prepared environment, we are able to control the upstream latency by part of the URL path):\n6.522875 - 6.314868 ~ 200ms.\nHowever, the rest of time: 6.314868 - 3.981139 ~ 2.230s is consumed in msc_process_request_headers, when we search for the access log entry related to\nthis processing we can see:\n2.235 upstream_header_time:2.438 status:200 request:(GET /users/200/random?arg=unknown HTTP/1.0)\n\n\nI would not bore you with the whole process of tracking down but go directly to the LMDB mdb_txn_begin function that starts the LMDB transaction.\nThat function is called for each LMDB lookup, so there are way more calls than in previous profiling.\nHowever, I prepared a command that allows us to aggregate all time consumed while waiting in that function.\n\n# trace-bpfcc -t 'p:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblmdb.so.0.0.0:mdb_txn_begin \"start\"' \\\n  'r:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/liblmdb.so.0.0.0:mdb_txn_begin \"stop\"' 2>/dev/null | tee /tmp/benchmark.log\n# cat /tmp/benchmark.log  | sort -n | awk '{if ($6 == \"start\") { data[$2] = $1} else { summary += 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]); print $1, $2, 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]) }} END {print \"Total time spent on locking: \", summary, \"ms,  number of calls: \", calls}'\n...\nTotal time spent on locking: 105891ms number of calls:  4064\n\n\nAs a comparison, we can execute the same profiling on version with a fix. Such a version is also available in a prepared environment.\n\ncat /tmp/benchmark.log  | sort -n | awk '{if ($6 == \"start\") { data[$2] = $1} else { calls++; summary += 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]); print $1, $2, 1000 * ($1 - data[$2]) }} END {print \"Total time spent on locking: \", summary, \"ms,  number of calls: \", calls}'\n...\nTotal time spent on locking: 1811.19ms  number of calls:  4064\n\n\nFixing the fix\nAs I have mentioned before, during the investigation we inspected source code that partially solves the problem.\nIt turned out that the fix merged to master does not work at all with the nginx plugin because of some initialization problems.\nThe PR that fixes the found problem has been merged and released in version 3.0.7 of ModSecurity.\nLessons learned\nMake sure that you inspect the exact version of the source code that you run\nOne of the struggles that we faced was scrutinizing the version of ModSecurity that had partially fixed the problem with exclusive read access to LMDB.\nFor sure, we had bad luck that the fix was available in master and not in the last released version that we then used, but at least we can confirm that the\ndevil is in the details.\nInstrumentation overhead\nWhen using such low level profiling methods you have to bear in mind that approach is quite invasive.\nIt means that such observation impacts the observed process.\nIt implies that it is hard to distinguish if we are observing root problems or just a consequence of harnessing very heavy instrumentation.\nSo, it is risky to draw conclusions from such observations.\nVerify your assumptions\nOur lack of understanding of how the particular phases of processing requests are computed led us to the false assumption that we could compute approximate\nModSecurity overhead by using simple arithmetic: request time - upstream time.\n\nIt was one of the biggest mistakes that hindered revealing the truth. It turned out that part of ModSecurity processing was included into upstream time,\nso the red part on above diagram also includes ModSecurity processing that is not part of establishing connection. As a form of self-punishment,\nwe extended the nginx-ModSecurity plugin in such a way that it allows measuring the overhead of\neach ModSecurity phase in a reliable way.\nLog timestamps\nIt may seem redundant because many logger collectors by default add their own timestamp of the moment when log entries are received in the collector.\nHowever, having a timestamp from the moment when the log is produced (without any delays) is crucial to reveal suspicious patterns/hangs on the producer\nside that can not be observed if timestamps are affected by random lags.\nDo (not) abuse undocumented behavior\nOne of the reasons that we faced this issue was abusing usage of ModSecurity collections.\nIn regular and documented usage such collections\nare considered to be simple key-value storage.\nWe discovered that under each key, we are able to store a list of values instead of a single value. If you consciously scanned the provided repository\n(especially ModSecurity rules) you could probably find a way to simulate a situation where multiple values are fetched while reading a single key.\nLet’s look at a rule that is available in the repository\n\nSecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:x-set-sample \"@eq 1\" \"phase:1,setvar:global.sample%{REQUEST_HEADERS:x-set-sample}=%{REQUEST_HEADERS:x-set-sample},log,deny,status:403,id:50,msg:'value of sample header is blocked',tag:'priority:1',tag:'action:deny'\"\n\n\nIf we call above rule with x-set-sample header with subsequent values 1, 2, 3. We can do that by making HTTP requests as below:\n\nworkstation # docker-compose exec nginx-before-fix bash\nnginx-with-lmdb # curl -I -H'x-set-sample: 1' localhost\nnginx-with-lmdb # curl -I -H'x-set-sample: 2' localhost\nnginx-with-lmdb # curl -I -H'x-set-sample: 3' localhost\n\n\nThen, we can expect that there will be stored three key-value pairs:\nglobals[sample1]=1\nglobals[sample2]=2\nglobals[sample3]=3\nIndeed, when we try to read LMDB in a very naive approach, values are stored the way we expect. We can see something like that:\n\nnginx-with-lmdb # strings /tmp/modsec-shared-collections\nsample::::sample11\nsample::::sample22\nsample::::sample33\n\n\nThe following rule that is interesting is supposed to check if a value under a particular key is equal to a query param.\nBasically, if the request contains query parameter arg=1, then we check if the value in the collection global, under the key sample is also “1”.\nIf the condition is met then the request will be blocked, which means that 403 status code will be returned.\n\nSecRule ARGS_GET \".*\" \"chain,phase:1,log,capture,deny,status:403,id:1001,msg:'value of param %{TX.0} is blocked',setvar:tx.param=%{TX.0}\"\n    SecRule global.sample \"@streq %{tx.param}\" \"t:none\"\n\n\nYou may be confused why we are reading the key sample that was never set.\nLet’s look what happens when we try to make a request with value 1 and -1.\nAs I described earlier, our intention was to check if global[sample] == 1.\n\nnginx-with-lmdb  # curl -I \"http://localhost/users/200/random?arg=1\"\nHTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\nServer: nginx/1.22.0 (Ubuntu)\nDate: Fri, 17 Nov 2023 10:58:39 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 162\nConnection: keep-alive\nnginx-with-lmdb\n\nnginx-with-lmdb  # curl -I \"http://localhost/users/200/random?arg=-1\"\nHTTP/1.1 200\nServer: nginx/1.22.0 (Ubuntu)\nDate: Fri, 17 Nov 2023 10:58:42 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 79\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n\n\nQuite interesting? It turns out that the match is fulfilled for value “1”, and surprisingly there is a log that gives us an insight:\n\nnginx-with-lmdb  # tail -5 /var/log/nginx/modsec_audit.log\n---TL9qTmAS---H--\nModSecurity: Access denied with code 403 (phase 1).

It may become clearer when we add more numbers.\n\nThis tree contains seven numbers, but we need to visit at most three nodes to locate any number.\nThe following example visualizes searching for 14.\nI used SQL to define the query in order to think about this tree as if it were an actual database index.\n\nHardware\nIn theory, using Binary Search Tree for running our queries looks fine. Its time complexity (when searching) is \\(O(log\nn)\\), same as B-tree. However, in practice, this data structure needs to work on actual hardware. An index must be\nstored somewhere on your machine.\nThe computer has three places where the data can be stored:\nCPU caches\nRAM (memory)\nDisk (storage)\nThe cache is managed fully by CPUs. Moreover, it is relatively small, usually a few megabytes.\nIndex may contain gigabytes of data, so it won’t fit there.\nDatabases vastly use Memory (RAM). It has some great advantages:\nassures fast random access (more on that in the next paragraph)\nits size may be pretty big (e.g. AWS RDS cloud service provides instances\nwith a few terabytes of memory available).\nCons? You lose the data when the power supply goes off. Moreover, when compared to the disk, it is pretty expensive.\nFinally, the cons of a memory are the pros of a disk storage.\nIt’s cheap, and data will remain there even if we lose the power.\nHowever, there are no free lunches!\nThe catch is that we need to be careful about random and sequential access.\nReading from the disk is fast, but only under certain conditions!\nI’ll try to explain them simply.\nRandom and sequential access\nMemory may be visualized as a line of containers for values, where every container is numbered.\n\nNow let’s assume we want to read data from containers 1, 4, and 6.
