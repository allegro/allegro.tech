It is not feasible to store such an amount of data on one physical node. We need a way to split that data into N data nodes.</p>\n\n<p>The technique for splitting the data is called data partitioning. There are a lot of techniques to partition your data.</p>\n\n<p>For online processing sources (like a database), you may pick some ID, for example, user-ID, and store a range of users on a dedicated node. For example, assuming that you have 1000 user IDs and 5 data nodes, the first node can store IDs from 0 to 200, the second node can store data from 201 to 400, and so on. When picking the partitioning scheme, you need to be careful not to introduce the data skew. Such a situation can occur when most of the data is produced by one or a group of IDs that belongs to the same data node. For example, let’s assume that the user ID 10 is responsible for 80% of our traffic and generates 80% of the data. Therefore, it will mean that 80% of the data is stored on the first data node, and our partitioning will not be optimal. In the worst case, this user’s amount of data may be too big to store on the given data node. It is important to note that for online processing, the partitioning is optimized for reading or writing data access patterns.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"offline-big-data-partitioning\">Offline big data partitioning</h2>\n\n<p>We will focus now on the offline, big data processing partitioning.</p>\n\n<p>For Big Data systems, we often need to store the historical data (cold data) for an “indefinite” amount of time. It is crucial to store the data for as long as we can. When the data is produced, we may not be aware of the business value that it can bring in the future. For example, we may save all user’s request data with all the HTTP headers. When the data is saved, there may be no use case for these HTTP headers. In the future, however, we may decide to build a tool that profiles our users by the type of device (Android, iOS) that they use. Such information is propagated in the HTTP headers. We can execute our new profiling logic based on the historical data because we stored it in the raw data. It is important to note here that the data was not needed for a long period.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we needed to store a lot of information and save it for later. Thus, our storage needs to contain a lot of data stored in cold storage. In Big Data applications, it often means that data is saved to a Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS). It also means that the data should be partitioned in a fairly generic way. We cannot optimize for read patterns because we cannot anticipate how those read patterns will look like.</p>\n\n<p>Because of these reasons, the most often used data partitioning scheme for big data offline processing is based on dates. Let’s assume that we have a system that saves user’s data on the /users file system path and clickstream data in the /clicks file system path. We will analyze the first data set that stores the user’s data. We are assuming that the number of records that we store is equal to 10 billion. We started collecting the data in the year 2017, and it’s been collected since then.</p>\n\n<p>The partitioning scheme that we pick is based on the date. It means that our partition identifier starts with the year. We will have 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 partitions. If we would have smaller data requirements, partitioning by year may be enough. In such a scenario, the file system path for our user’s data would be /users/2017, /users/2018, and so on. It will be analogical for clicks: /clicks/2017, /clicks/2018, and so on.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-08-10-splitting-data-that-does-not-fit-on-one-machine-using-data-partitioning/img1.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"four-data-partitions\">Four data partitions</h2>\n\n<p>By using this partitioning, the user’s data will have 4 partitions. It means that we can split the data into up to four physical data nodes. The first node will store the data for the year 2017, the second node for 2018, etc. Nothing prevents us from keeping all of those partitions on the same physical node when having four partitions. We may be ok with storing the data on one physical node as long as we have enough disk space. Once the disk space runs out, we can create a new physical node and move some of the partitions to the new node.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, such a partitioning scheme is too coarse-grained. Having one big partition for all year’s data is hard from both a read and write perspective. When you read such data and are interested only in events from a particular date, you need to scan the whole year’s data. It’s very inefficient and time-consuming. It is also problematic from the writing perspective because if your disk space runs out, there is no easy way to split the data further. You won’t be able to perform a successful write.</p>\n\n<p>Because of that reason, offline big data systems tend to partition the data in a more fine-grained fashion. The data is partitioned by year, month, and even day. For example, if you are writing data for the 2nd of January 2020, you will save the event into a /users/2020/01/02 partition. Such a partitioning gives you a lot of flexibility at the read side as well. If you wish to analyze events for a specific day, you can directly read the data from the partition. If you want to perform some higher-level analysis, for example, analyze the whole month’s data, you can read all partitions within a given month. The same pattern applies if you want to analyze a whole year’s data.</p>\n\n<p>To sum up, our 10 billion records will be partitioned in the following way:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-08-10-splitting-data-that-does-not-fit-on-one-machine-using-data-partitioning/img2.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"date-based-data-partitioning\">Date based data partitioning</h2>\n\n<p>You can see that the initial 10 billion records are partitioned into year/month, and finally, a specific date of the month. In the end, each day’s partition contains a hundred thousand records. Such an amount of data can easily fit into one machine disk space. It also means that we have 365/366 partitions per year. The upper number of data nodes on which we can partition the data is equal to the number of days * the number of years we store data. If your one-day data does not fit into one machine disk space, you can easily partition your data further by hours of the day, minutes, seconds, and so on.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"partitioning-vs-sharding\">Partitioning vs sharding</h2>\n\n<p>Assuming that we have our data partitioned by the date, we can split that data into multiple nodes. In such a scenario, we are putting a subset of all partition keys in a physical node.</p>\n\n<p>Our user’s data is partitioned into N partitions (logical shards). Let’s assume that our partition granularity is a month. In that case, the data for the year 2020 has 12 partitions that can be split horizontally into N physical nodes (physical shards). It is important to note that N is less than or equal to 12. In other words, the maximum level of physical shards is 12. This architecture pattern is called sharding.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s assume that we have three physical nodes. In that case, we can say that our user’s data for the year 2020 is partitioned into 12 partitions. Next, they are assigned to 3 shards (nodes). Each of the nodes stores 4 partitions for 2020 (12 partitions / 3 nodes = 4 partitions/node).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-08-10-splitting-data-that-does-not-fit-on-one-machine-using-data-partitioning/img1.png\" alt=\"Figure 8.6.

I think that after all this time we can safely say that this direction was correct and remained almost entirely unchanged in relation to the original idea. Still, some of the challenges foreseen in the publication soon became the reality. In this article I would like to focus on the CSS part of the whole adventure to tell you about how we manage consistency and frontend performance across over half a thousand components, and what it took us to get to where we stand today.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"new-approach--new-challenges\">New Approach — New Challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Handling all the dependencies, libraries and visual compatibility when the entire website resides in a single repository is a challenge by itself. The level of difficulty increases even more, when there are hundreds of said repositories, each managed by a different team and tooling. When in such situation, one of the things that quickly become apparent is the need for some kind of guidelines around the look of various aspects of components being developed like color scheme, spacing, fonts etc. — those are exactly the reasons why the Metrum Design System came to life.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-07-29-css-architecture-and-performance-of-micro-frontends/metrum-design-system.jpg\" alt=\"Metrum Design System\" title=\"Metrum Design System\" /></p>\n\n<p>In its initial form — apart from visual examples and design resources — Metrum was providing reusable PostCSS mixins that every developer could install via separate npm packages and include in the component they were working on.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-scss highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">@import</span> <span class=\"s1\">'node_modules/@metrum/button/css/mixins.css'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"nc\">.button</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">@mixin</span> <span class=\"nf\">m-button</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nl\">background-color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"no\">black</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-html highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;button</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"button\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If we try to evaluate that approach we could come up with following pros and cons:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Easy to use — install mixin and include in component’s selector;</li>\n  <li>Mixins allow for sharing visual identity between components;</li>\n  <li>Developers can use mixins in any version without depending on other parts of the page;</li>\n  <li>Every component ships with a complete set of styles.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Including mixins introduces duplication of CSS rules between components used on the same page;</li>\n  <li>More files — every component brings at least one request for its styles;</li>\n  <li>No sharing of CSS — no cache reuse between pages built from different components;</li>\n  <li>Clashing of class names within the global namespace.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary, while being very flexible and easy to use, mixins-based approach was not ideal from a performance point of view. Every time when somebody wanted to use a button, input, link etc., they would have to include a mixin for it pulling the entire set of CSS rules to their stylesheet. This resulted in our users downloading unnecessary kilobytes during the first visit while bringing no caching benefit when navigating through other pages which in turn increased rendering times. We knew we could do better.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"enter-css-modules\">Enter CSS Modules</h3>\n\n<p>After a lot of brainstorming, a decision was made that the next step should involve Metrum making use of CSS Modules. While the technical aspects and usage were changing as the adoption grew, the main principles stayed the same up to this day. Currently, whenever any developer wants to assemble a new component out of Metrum building blocks, they can install desired packages, compose styles from them and declare used classes in their markup:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-scss highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nc\">.button</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">composes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">m-button</span> <span class=\"n\">from</span> <span class=\"s1\">'@metrum/button'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">composes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">m-background-color-black</span> <span class=\"n\">from</span> <span class=\"s1\">'@metrum/color'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"nx\">styles</span> <span class=\"k\">from</span> <span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">./styles.css</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">export</span> <span class=\"k\">default</span> <span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">render</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"s2\">`\n        &lt;button class=\"</span><span class=\"p\">${</span><span class=\"nx\">styles</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">button</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"&gt;...&lt;/button&gt;\n    `</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Thanks to the fact that all of our micro frontends run on Node.js, this approach can be used quite easily with the majority of tooling available. The only thing left to do is to collect all of the required Metrum stylesheets during render in our facade server called opbox-web and embed them on the page with the correct order. Ordering requirement is important, because we follow atomic design and more complicated components (molecules, organisms) are built using simpler ones (atoms). Lets see what all of those changes did to our list of tradeoffs:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Still easy to use — install package and compose desired classes in your component;</li>\n  <li>Sharing classes means sharing visual traits which was one of our goals;</li>\n  <li>Styles for certain module only appear once per page if used in multiple components;</li>\n  <li>Each Metrum stylesheet can be cached by the browser separately and reused on different pages;</li>\n  <li>Developers can still use packages in any version without depending on other parts of the page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Additional logic has to be maintained that extracts needed Metrum stylesheets from components and adds them to the page once;</li>\n  <li>Above logic has to also take care of sorting so the order of styles is correct and we don’t run into problems with cascade;</li>\n  <li>Multiple versions of the same Metrum component may be needed on the page;</li>\n  <li>More and more requests have to be made as components transition to the new approach.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Judging from the upsides the transition was worth it: despite higher maintenance effort we were finally able to share common CSS code between components, the amount of downloaded data as well as render times started decreasing. Unfortunately, after some time we started to see a worrying trend related to the number of embedded stylesheets. Prior to this change, it was roughly equal to the number of components used on the page. Afterwards, with additional Metrum modules, plus the fact that multiple versions of them may be needed, we ended up with as much as around 100 requests for render-blocking CSS.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, when we bring up the issue of excessive number of requests people respond with “So what? You have HTTP/2, right?” and yes, we do. It’s true that the user agent will reuse existing connections for multiple files but the limit of concurrent streams does exist, latency is still going to affect each one of them and the compression efficiency will be worse especially for those relatively small files like ours. We had to come up with yet another idea for improvement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"let-the-bundle-begin\">Let the Bundle Begin</h3>\n\n<p>As I touched briefly earlier, we have the opbox-web — a place that’s already responsible for extracting, sorting and embedding Metrum dependencies. We figured that instead of adding each of them separately, we could prepare predefined bundles that would serve as replacements. We did as planned and, after deployment on 6th of July 2020, achieved 15% improvement in FCP metric time, which means that our users saw the first render of content faster by almost half a second.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-07-29-css-architecture-and-performance-of-micro-frontends/fcp-after-metrum-bundle.png\" alt=\"FCP metric chart before and after deployment of Metrum bundle\" title=\"FCP metric chart before and after deployment of Metrum bundle\" /></p>\n\n<p>Improvement was satisfactory, but it came at a certain cost. From that time on we had to make sure all of the components used on a certain page share the same versions of Metrum modules supported by the bundle and I assure you, it was bothersome to say the least. Monitoring that nobody updated their dependency by accident was one thing (especially that we managed to automate it) but undergoing a process of actually wanting to do this was another. In addition, every time we failed within that area we had to bail and serve every stylesheet separately, preventing incorrect order of CSS and bringing performance to the previous low.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>CSS Modules usage stayed the same;</li>\n  <li>Fewer requests for critical resources resulted in noticeable improvement in FCP metric.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Extra work is needed to keep Metrum packages versions aligned;</li>\n  <li>Updating Metrum dependencies becomes much harder as it requires synchronization between all of the components on a certain page;</li>\n  <li>All of the above meant that we only managed to enable this feature on the most popular of routes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We knew there was going to be additional effort to maintain this solution but the performance gains outweighed the cost at that time. It took almost a year of tedious work from multiple teams to keep the look and feel of Allegro up to date with newest changes, until we came up with another idea.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"just-in-time-bundling\">Just In Time Bundling</h3>\n\n<p>In the beginning of 2021 another idea started to form. This time we wanted to unlock the agile nature of our Micro Frontends and their deployment. We came to the conclusion that it would be ideal if instead of serving bundles containing a predefined list of components, we could send one composed of just the files that were actually required to render a certain page. Collecting the list of CSS that’s needed was not the problem — we were generating the HEAD section after all — but generating these unique bundles, well that was something different.</p>\n\n<p>First option we had to verify was the possibility to prepare all of the bundles beforehand so they can be picked and served from CDN.

I think that after all this time we can safely say that this direction was correct and remained almost entirely unchanged in relation to the original idea. Still, some of the challenges foreseen in the publication soon became the reality. In this article I would like to focus on the CSS part of the whole adventure to tell you about how we manage consistency and frontend performance across over half a thousand components, and what it took us to get to where we stand today.\nNew Approach — New Challenges\nHandling all the dependencies, libraries and visual compatibility when the entire website resides in a single repository is a challenge by itself. The level of difficulty increases even more, when there are hundreds of said repositories, each managed by a different team and tooling. When in such situation, one of the things that quickly become apparent is the need for some kind of guidelines around the look of various aspects of components being developed like color scheme, spacing, fonts etc. — those are exactly the reasons why the Metrum Design System came to life.\n\nIn its initial form — apart from visual examples and design resources — Metrum was providing reusable PostCSS mixins that every developer could install via separate npm packages and include in the component they were working on.\n\n@import 'node_modules/@metrum/button/css/mixins.css';\n\n.button {\n    @mixin m-button;\n    background-color: black;\n}\n\n\n\n<button class=\"button\"></button>\n\n\nIf we try to evaluate that approach we could come up with following pros and cons:\nPros\nEasy to use — install mixin and include in component’s selector;\nMixins allow for sharing visual identity between components;\nDevelopers can use mixins in any version without depending on other parts of the page;\nEvery component ships with a complete set of styles.\nCons\nIncluding mixins introduces duplication of CSS rules between components used on the same page;\nMore files — every component brings at least one request for its styles;\nNo sharing of CSS — no cache reuse between pages built from different components;\nClashing of class names within the global namespace.\nIn summary, while being very flexible and easy to use, mixins-based approach was not ideal from a performance point of view. Every time when somebody wanted to use a button, input, link etc., they would have to include a mixin for it pulling the entire set of CSS rules to their stylesheet. This resulted in our users downloading unnecessary kilobytes during the first visit while bringing no caching benefit when navigating through other pages which in turn increased rendering times. We knew we could do better.\nEnter CSS Modules\nAfter a lot of brainstorming, a decision was made that the next step should involve Metrum making use of CSS Modules. While the technical aspects and usage were changing as the adoption grew, the main principles stayed the same up to this day. Currently, whenever any developer wants to assemble a new component out of Metrum building blocks, they can install desired packages, compose styles from them and declare used classes in their markup:\n\n.button {\n    composes: m-button from '@metrum/button';\n    composes: m-background-color-black from '@metrum/color';\n}\n\n\n\nimport * as styles from './styles.css';\n\nexport default function render() {\n    return `\n        <button class=\"${styles.button}\">...</button>\n    `;\n}\n\n\nThanks to the fact that all of our micro frontends run on Node.js, this approach can be used quite easily with the majority of tooling available. The only thing left to do is to collect all of the required Metrum stylesheets during render in our facade server called opbox-web and embed them on the page with the correct order. Ordering requirement is important, because we follow atomic design and more complicated components (molecules, organisms) are built using simpler ones (atoms). Lets see what all of those changes did to our list of tradeoffs:\nPros\nStill easy to use — install package and compose desired classes in your component;\nSharing classes means sharing visual traits which was one of our goals;\nStyles for certain module only appear once per page if used in multiple components;\nEach Metrum stylesheet can be cached by the browser separately and reused on different pages;\nDevelopers can still use packages in any version without depending on other parts of the page.\nCons\nAdditional logic has to be maintained that extracts needed Metrum stylesheets from components and adds them to the page once;\nAbove logic has to also take care of sorting so the order of styles is correct and we don’t run into problems with cascade;\nMultiple versions of the same Metrum component may be needed on the page;\nMore and more requests have to be made as components transition to the new approach.\nJudging from the upsides the transition was worth it: despite higher maintenance effort we were finally able to share common CSS code between components, the amount of downloaded data as well as render times started decreasing. Unfortunately, after some time we started to see a worrying trend related to the number of embedded stylesheets. Prior to this change, it was roughly equal to the number of components used on the page. Afterwards, with additional Metrum modules, plus the fact that multiple versions of them may be needed, we ended up with as much as around 100 requests for render-blocking CSS.\nUsually, when we bring up the issue of excessive number of requests people respond with “So what? You have HTTP/2, right?” and yes, we do. It’s true that the user agent will reuse existing connections for multiple files but the limit of concurrent streams does exist, latency is still going to affect each one of them and the compression efficiency will be worse especially for those relatively small files like ours. We had to come up with yet another idea for improvement.\nLet the Bundle Begin\nAs I touched briefly earlier, we have the opbox-web — a place that’s already responsible for extracting, sorting and embedding Metrum dependencies. We figured that instead of adding each of them separately, we could prepare predefined bundles that would serve as replacements. We did as planned and, after deployment on 6th of July 2020, achieved 15% improvement in FCP metric time, which means that our users saw the first render of content faster by almost half a second.\n\nImprovement was satisfactory, but it came at a certain cost. From that time on we had to make sure all of the components used on a certain page share the same versions of Metrum modules supported by the bundle and I assure you, it was bothersome to say the least. Monitoring that nobody updated their dependency by accident was one thing (especially that we managed to automate it) but undergoing a process of actually wanting to do this was another. In addition, every time we failed within that area we had to bail and serve every stylesheet separately, preventing incorrect order of CSS and bringing performance to the previous low.\nPros\nCSS Modules usage stayed the same;\nFewer requests for critical resources resulted in noticeable improvement in FCP metric.\nCons\nExtra work is needed to keep Metrum packages versions aligned;\nUpdating Metrum dependencies becomes much harder as it requires synchronization between all of the components on a certain page;\nAll of the above meant that we only managed to enable this feature on the most popular of routes.\nWe knew there was going to be additional effort to maintain this solution but the performance gains outweighed the cost at that time. It took almost a year of tedious work from multiple teams to keep the look and feel of Allegro up to date with newest changes, until we came up with another idea.\nJust In Time Bundling\nIn the beginning of 2021 another idea started to form. This time we wanted to unlock the agile nature of our Micro Frontends and their deployment. We came to the conclusion that it would be ideal if instead of serving bundles containing a predefined list of components, we could send one composed of just the files that were actually required to render a certain page. Collecting the list of CSS that’s needed was not the problem — we were generating the HEAD section after all — but generating these unique bundles, well that was something different.\nFirst option we had to verify was the possibility to prepare all of the bundles beforehand so they can be picked and served from CDN. Sadly, taking into account that there are around 500 components, any of which can either be used as a building block of a certain page or not, gives us 2500 combinations which is way more than we can handle. Even if we optimistically assumed that each stylesheet required around 50ms to generate, it would take us roughly 5x10141 years to cover everything. Additionally, it would not only be a waste of time and storage (some components have higher possibility to be used than others) but also at least a portion of the work would have to be redone every time a component is updated, what can happen multiple times a day.\nFinally, we went with a different approach by implementing a bundler microservice. Its operating principle can be explained in a few steps:\nWhen user makes a request for a page, our server collects a list of CSS files that would normally be added to the HEAD section;\nIt sends this list of files to our microservice asking for an URL to the corresponding bundle that contains them;\nThe microservice checks if it has the bundle in its cache:\n    \nIf it does, then bundle URL is immediately returned;\nOtherwise, it also responds right away with empty result, triggering bundle generation in the background;\nBased on the response from the microservice, the server either embeds separate CSS files as usual or replaces them with a single bundle.\nThis is where we are now – generating only what is actually needed and keeping the duration overhead minimal. A lot of thought and multiple iterations went into making it possible, so I think you can expect a completely separate article about this microservice in the future. Most important thing for us is that the trend of constant improvement for our users continues as confirmed by Chrome UX Report:\n\nSummary\nCSS architecture is one of the most important factors influencing performance, what makes ignoring it harder and harder as the page grows.

There is another follow-up question: is every request worth\nretrying? Imagine a server responding with status code <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403\">403 (forbidden)</a>,\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/422\">422 (unprocessable entity)</a>, or 4xx in general.

Sometimes when you receive 5xx, there is no guarantee that it has not been processed. Imagine retrying a request\nto make a money transfer from one account to another - handling it twice would be a disaster! In order to prevent these mistakes from happening, you have to\nmake sure your API is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent\">idempotent</a>. This is usually achieved by using adequate HTTP methods\n(like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT\">PUT</a>) or passing an additional identifier with the request.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"do-not-wait-forever\">Do not wait forever</h3>\n<p>Have you ever wondered how long it takes before an API call times out due to no response from the server? If not, I have bad news for you -\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/timeout\">the default timeout value in XMLHttpRequest is 0</a>, which basically means the browser will wait forever.\nWith <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API\">fetch</a> there is no parameter responsible for timeouts - it relies on browser defaults (which\nis 300 seconds for <a href=\"https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:net/socket/client_socket_pool.cc;l=29\">Chrome</a> and\n<a href=\"https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpHandler.cpp#219\">Firefox</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is that you can actually implement timeout functionality using\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController\">AbortController</a>:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">controller</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">AbortController</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">timeout</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nx\">setTimeout</span><span class=\"p\">(()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">controller</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">abort</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span> <span class=\"mi\">3000</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"c1\">// 3s timeout</span>\n\n<span class=\"nx\">fetch</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">/api/something</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"na\">signal</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">controller</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">signal</span> <span class=\"p\">})</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">then</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">clearTimeout</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">timeout</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// process the response</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">});</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Another useful application of AbortController is cancelling straggler requests (requests still in progress at a point when the response is no longer needed).\nThis is particularly useful in libraries like <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a> where receiving a response after unmounting a component results in an error:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nx\">useEffect</span><span class=\"p\">(()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">controller</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"nx\">AbortController</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n\n  <span class=\"nx\">fetch</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">/api/something</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"na\">signal</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nx\">controller</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">signal</span> <span class=\"p\">})</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">then</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"c1\">// process the response</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">});</span>\n\n  <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"nx\">controller</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">abort</span><span class=\"p\">();</span> <span class=\"c1\">// cancel the request when un-mounting the component</span>\n<span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">[]);</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"be-optimistic\">Be optimistic</h3>\n<p>As funny as it may sound, there is an actual pattern called “optimistic UI”. The idea behind it is very straightforward: given that most of the time an API\nrequest will result in a successful response, we can skip the “loading” part and go straight to a result stage. In the unlikely event of failure, we can still\nrollback our changes and inform the user about the error.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s consider a popular example of a counter (eg. Facebook/Twitter like button).

If not, I have bad news for you -\nthe default timeout value in XMLHttpRequest is 0, which basically means the browser will wait forever.\nWith fetch there is no parameter responsible for timeouts - it relies on browser defaults (which\nis 300 seconds for Chrome and\nFirefox.\nThe good news is that you can actually implement timeout functionality using\nAbortController:\n\nconst controller = new AbortController();\nconst timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 3000); // 3s timeout\n\nfetch(\"/api/something\", { signal: controller.signal })\n  .then(response => {\n    clearTimeout(timeout);\n    // process the response\n  });\n\n\nAnother useful application of AbortController is cancelling straggler requests (requests still in progress at a point when the response is no longer needed).\nThis is particularly useful in libraries like React where receiving a response after unmounting a component results in an error:\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const controller = new AbortController();\n\n  fetch(\"/api/something\", { signal: controller.signal })\n    .then(response => {\n      // process the response\n    });\n\n  return () => controller.abort(); // cancel the request when un-mounting the component\n}, []);\n\n\nBe optimistic\nAs funny as it may sound, there is an actual pattern called “optimistic UI”. The idea behind it is very straightforward: given that most of the time an API\nrequest will result in a successful response, we can skip the “loading” part and go straight to a result stage. In the unlikely event of failure, we can still\nrollback our changes and inform the user about the error.\nLet’s consider a popular example of a counter (eg. Facebook/Twitter like button). For the sake of simplicity I will skip the actual request and return a\npromise after 1 second so that approximately 25% of requests will fail:\n\nCounter value: <span id=\"counter\">0</span> <button id=\"button\">Increase</button>\n\n<script>\n  let counter = 0;\n\n  const updateView = () => document.querySelector(\"#counter\").innerText = counter;\n\n  const makeRequest = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const outcome = Math.random() > 0.25 ? resolve : reject;\n    setTimeout(outcome, 1000);\n  });\n\n  document.querySelector(\"#button\").addEventListener(\"click\", async () => {\n    counter++;\n    updateView();\n\n    try {\n      await makeRequest();\n    } catch (e) {\n      counter--;\n      updateView();\n    }\n  });\n</script>\n\n\nBy simply assuming the positive outcome we drastically reduce the amount of time spent on the interactions, making the whole experience more swift. However,\ndue to the risk of so-called false positives this pattern should not\nbe applied to critical actions (for example, making a reservation). If you are further interested I recommend reading a\nmore comprehensive article about optimistic UI.\nSummary\nIn this article, I presented the basics of requests handling. Some of these ideas (like retries and timeouts) also apply to the backend service-to-service\ncommunication. Additionally, there are other interesting techniques which I encourage you to study (eg. preconnecting, batching). In the end, in my opinion,\neverything that improves UX is worth a try.","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/07/making-api-calls-seamless-ux.html","categories":["javascript","frontend","ajax","restapi","http"],"isoDate":"2021-07-20T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"},{"title":"One task — two solutions: Apache Spark or Apache Beam?","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/1-task-2-solutions-spark-or-beam.html","pubDate":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0200","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Yevgeniya Li"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/yevgeniya.li.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/yevgeniya.li"]}]},"content":"<p>Some time ago, our team faced the issue of moving an existing <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org\">Apache Spark</a> job from an on-premise Hadoop cluster to public cloud.\nWhile working on the transition we came across another way to process data that is <a href=\"https://beam.apache.org\">Apache Beam</a>.

Additionally running tests with BigFlow CLI is more convenient and faster compared with sbt.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Scala is much closer to our team (mostly Java developers), especially at the beginning when we needed to get used to working with Python\nwithout static typing. Also Scala is more natural for Spark, so all upcoming features will be firstly supported for this programming language, educational\nresources and examples in Scala for Spark are more exhaustive.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"batch-and-stream-data-processing\">Batch and stream data processing</h3>\n\n<p>In our projects we did not implement stream data processing, since we have batch processing only, but anyway it is probable that business requirements could\nchange so we must also consider how to do it in a better way.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Two different APIs for batch/stream data processing.

An additional bonus here is the useful feature for\n        windowing (a way to split data during stream processing), watermarks and triggers (handling events that come late or out-of-order).\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: although we didn’t try it ourselves, we’d bet on Apache Beam in this comparison. It looks more adapted for Streaming than Spark.\nAlthough there is a streaming extension since Spark 2.2 but libraries of streaming functions are quite limited. For us this means more efforts to apply.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"testing\">Testing</h3>\n\n<p>Along with the development process these projects were getting more complicated - so we realized the unit testing is not enough to make us feel safe.

This way we were ensuring introduced changes did not impact performance and both return identical results.\n        Note: recently BigFlow added a <a href=\"https://github.com/allegro/bigflow/blob/master/docs/e2e_testing.md\">solution</a> by setting real Dataflow/BigQuery\n        infrastructure while running E2E tests\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: a solution is to minimize the ratio of missing test coverage and isolate classes responsible for I/O operations to external storages\n(Google Storage and BigQuery) as much as possible. Big issue is to provide these dependencies while running tests inside CI pipeline but this is completely\nanother story. In both cases, it is not trivial task. So, for the sake of simplicity we were ensuring there are no performance issues and jobs are not broken by\nrunning them on a dev environment using the production data which also took us a lot of time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-run\">Local run</h3>\n\n<p>Local run in our case does not mean 100% execution on the laptop: job is triggered from the local machine, but actually it has a place on the real cluster\nin Google Cloud.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Natively via Spark submit command.

However, even here, not everything is so clear as we have two services to run our\njobs and we described our considerations about them below.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%; vertical-align: top;\">\n        <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataproc\">Dataproc</a> (Hadoop under the hood which is required to run Spark). As we do not need to have it running all the time, we deployed it for each job\n        execution, luckily we again have benefited from Terraform to do it. Also we used it to spin up the network, subnetwork, router and other things that are\n        needed to run the Spark job within Dataproc, so I would generally recommend it as a useful tool to automate things in GCP. Dataproc has autoscaling\n        feature, but it requires more actions: creating autoscaling policy in GCP and integrating it into the job. Moreover, to achieve good performance we\n        needed to play a lot with Spark configuration like tuning memory on workers, choosing appropriate number of shuffle partitions, executor instances and\n        so on.\n        </td>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataflow\">Dataflow</a>. Due to its serverless nature we didn’t need to set up a cluster each time we wanted to process data. The next big advantage\n        of Dataflow is the Shuffle service, which addresses the shuffle issue on Spark executors as it moves heavy operation out of the worker virtual machine\n        to the service backend. Besides, there is autoscaling out-of-the-box, Streaming engine for streaming pipeline support. Generally, Dataflow is supposed\n        to be a self-managed platform, so less effort is required to configure it compared to Dataproc.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Dataflow wins in terms of ease of the setup. However, there is one more drawback here: limitation to run on the public cloud. It was so\nconvenient for us to profit from Dataflow services that it would be hard to find appropriate substitution for them. Furthermore, BigFlow framework\npositions itself as a Python framework for data processing pipelines on GCP. So if we want to migrate to another platform, this would enforce us to\nconfigure another runner so that we are able to run the job properly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monitoring\">Monitoring</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to the process itself, it is crucial to have an option to observe its workflow, collect metrics and have access to logs from the machines.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Familiar dashboard with Yarn metrics at our disposal - Spark UI is the same that we had in the Hadoop cluster on-premise.

Another issue was with Spark logs UI view, as if you open it by clicking on the particular running job, you\n        can see only the part of them. The rest can be found in GCP Logger where you need to know how to build queries to fetch them. Also Dataproc does not\n        keep the history of metrics once the cluster is shut down. You need to spin up a separate Spark history server to collect them and then configure its\n        visualisation in GCP Monitoring.\n        </td>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Logs from workers and metrics are displayed on the same UI and are available even after the job is finished.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Dataflow beats Dataproc here and that is it.

As it was basically a pilot project, we calculated the cost of\nnon-optimized jobs to see how much it is without significant tuning.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:20%;\"></th>\n        <th style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:20%;\">Cost</td>\n        <td style=\"width:80%; text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\">\n        Approximately on the same level, slightly in favour of Apache Spark\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:20%;\">Time</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">1.5h</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">1h</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: cost is almost the same, however we need to highlight that Spark job has much more space to optimize while Apache Beam job already\ncontains Dataflow optimizations out-of-the-box. For example: playing more with Spark configuration, experimenting with Dataproc workers number, etc, so\nprobably it would cost less and run faster if you know how to tune it properly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>At the end we’d like to say that Spark Job could be more beneficial if you know it well. Additionally, Dataproc requires advanced skills close to\nthe experienced DevOps engineer to organize all necessary infrastructure. But if you do not have an engineer with deep BigData experience in your team or you\nrun out of time and you are ready to pay a little bit more for out-of-the-box features, then Apache Beam + Dataflow is your choice.

I just would like to\nprovide some context of our team’s background to give you better understanding of our preferences: most of us are specialised in the software development in\nKotlin so we were a little bit biased against non JVM-based languages before starting this task.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nAirflow\n        (the tool which automates running the job in the cluster).\n        \n        \n        Natively available in Java and Python, but since we took advantage of the BigFlow framework, Python was used for everything.\n        \n    \nsbt is used for building the package and running the tests. This can be more beneficial for\n        Java developers who are familiar with Gradle: it uses the build.sbt configuration file, which like build.gradle declares dependencies, the Scala version\n        to use, etc.\n        \n        \n        Setuptools (tool for building Python packages) is run by script.py build script\n        provided by BigFlow. This framework also provides an additional mechanism for managing dependencies which is based on the standard\n        pip-tool. Additionally running tests with BigFlow CLI is more convenient and faster compared with sbt.\n        \n    \nSummary: Scala is much closer to our team (mostly Java developers), especially at the beginning when we needed to get used to working with Python\nwithout static typing. Also Scala is more natural for Spark, so all upcoming features will be firstly supported for this programming language, educational\nresources and examples in Scala for Spark are more exhaustive.\nBatch and stream data processing\nIn our projects we did not implement stream data processing, since we have batch processing only, but anyway it is probable that business requirements could\nchange so we must also consider how to do it in a better way.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nSummary: although we didn’t try it ourselves, we’d bet on Apache Beam in this comparison. It looks more adapted for Streaming than Spark.\nAlthough there is a streaming extension since Spark 2.2 but libraries of streaming functions are quite limited. For us this means more efforts to apply.\nTesting\nAlong with the development process these projects were getting more complicated - so we realized the unit testing is not enough to make us feel safe. So below\nare our researches how to ensure the jobs will be able to handle big load in a production environment.\n\n        Apache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nUnit tests (local environment without access to real infrastructure, validation of business logic)\n        \n        Embedded Spark\n        \n        \n        TestPipeline\n        \n    \nIntegration tests (validation of proper reads/writes from/to BigQuery)\n        No official support for mocking BigQuery/Google Storage or embedded/test container version\n    \nE2E tests (ensure job is executed, run in Cloud and has integration with GCP infrastructure)\n        \n        Due to the missing implementation of testing the whole flow, we were running locally jobs to load production data, process them and store into BigQuery\n        tables for development purposes. This way we were ensuring introduced changes did not impact performance and both return identical results.\n        Note: recently BigFlow added a solution by setting real Dataflow/BigQuery\n        infrastructure while running E2E tests\n        \n    \nSummary: a solution is to minimize the ratio of missing test coverage and isolate classes responsible for I/O operations to external storages\n(Google Storage and BigQuery) as much as possible. Big issue is to provide these dependencies while running tests inside CI pipeline but this is completely\nanother story. In both cases, it is not trivial task. So, for the sake of simplicity we were ensuring there are no performance issues and jobs are not broken by\nrunning them on a dev environment using the production data which also took us a lot of time.\nLocal run\nLocal run in our case does not mean 100% execution on the laptop: job is triggered from the local machine, but actually it has a place on the real cluster\nin Google Cloud.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nSummary: no absolute winner here, depends on your preferences. Beside this we found Terraform to be a fine separate tool to set up a local\nenvironment for running the job and could be used for Apache Beam job as well.\nRunning on the GCP\nOnce we are done with the local development, we are good to go to the Cloud! However, even here, not everything is so clear as we have two services to run our\njobs and we described our considerations about them below.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nDataproc (Hadoop under the hood which is required to run Spark). As we do not need to have it running all the time, we deployed it for each job\n        execution, luckily we again have benefited from Terraform to do it. Also we used it to spin up the network, subnetwork, router and other things that are\n        needed to run the Spark job within Dataproc, so I would generally recommend it as a useful tool to automate things in GCP. Dataproc has autoscaling\n        feature, but it requires more actions: creating autoscaling policy in GCP and integrating it into the job. Moreover, to achieve good performance we\n        needed to play a lot with Spark configuration like tuning memory on workers, choosing appropriate number of shuffle partitions, executor instances and\n        so on.\n        \n        \n        Dataflow. Due to its serverless nature we didn’t need to set up a cluster each time we wanted to process data. The next big advantage\n        of Dataflow is the Shuffle service, which addresses the shuffle issue on Spark executors as it moves heavy operation out of the worker virtual machine\n        to the service backend. Besides, there is autoscaling out-of-the-box, Streaming engine for streaming pipeline support. Generally, Dataflow is supposed\n        to be a self-managed platform, so less effort is required to configure it compared to Dataproc.\n        \n    \nSummary: Dataflow wins in terms of ease of the setup. However, there is one more drawback here: limitation to run on the public cloud. It was so\nconvenient for us to profit from Dataflow services that it would be hard to find appropriate substitution for them. Furthermore, BigFlow framework\npositions itself as a Python framework for data processing pipelines on GCP. So if we want to migrate to another platform, this would enforce us to\nconfigure another runner so that we are able to run the job properly.\nMonitoring\nIn addition to the process itself, it is crucial to have an option to observe its workflow, collect metrics and have access to logs from the machines.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nSummary: Dataflow beats Dataproc here and that is it. No comments are required.\nCost\nLast but not least is the pricing of used GCP resources needed to process data like setting and running a cluster, storing data and queries execution in\nBigQuery, etc. Here we are most likely talking not only about the money, but also about the time. As it was basically a pilot project, we calculated the cost of\nnon-optimized jobs to see how much it is without significant tuning.\n\n        Apache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nCost\n        \n        Approximately on the same level, slightly in favour of Apache Spark\n        \n    \nTime\n        1.5h\n        1h\n    \nSummary: cost is almost the same, however we need to highlight that Spark job has much more space to optimize while Apache Beam job already\ncontains Dataflow optimizations out-of-the-box. For example: playing more with Spark configuration, experimenting with Dataproc workers number, etc, so\nprobably it would cost less and run faster if you know how to tune it properly.\nConclusion\nAt the end we’d like to say that Spark Job could be more beneficial if you know it well. Additionally, Dataproc requires advanced skills close to\nthe experienced DevOps engineer to organize all necessary infrastructure. But if you do not have an engineer with deep BigData experience in your team or you\nrun out of time and you are ready to pay a little bit more for out-of-the-box features, then Apache Beam + Dataflow is your choice. Also remember even if you\npay a little bit more, it means that you are saving developers’ time spent on the Spark tweaking that may bring some value.\nBelow you can find how we’d estimate entry level for skills that were necessary for us to develop using the two technologies.\n\n        Apache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nProgramming languages\n        Scala (Intermediate)\n        Python (Intermediate)\n    \nTechnology stack\n        Apache Spark (Advanced)\n        Apache Beam (Intermediate)\n    \nBigFlow (Advanced)\n    \nGoogle Dataproc (Intermediate)\n        Google DataFlow (Intermediate) \n    \nGoogle Logging (Basic)\n        \n    \nTerraform (Intermediate)\n        \n    \nGoogle BigQuery (Basic)\n    \nGoogle Composer to schedule jobs in GCP (Basic)\n    \nGoogle Cloud Storage (Basic)\n    \n\n\n.post img{margin: 0 auto;display: block;}\ntd {\n  vertical-align: top;\n}\n@media (max-width: 400px) {\n  table {\n    font-size: 0.8em;\n  }\n}\n@media (max-width: 350px) {\n  table {\n    font-size: 0.6em;\n  }\n}","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/1-task-2-solutions-spark-or-beam.html","categories":["tech","Apache Spark","Apache Beam","BigFlow","BigData","GCP"],"isoDate":"2021-06-27T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"}],"jobs":[{"id":"743999765816116","name":"Senior Product Manager (Allegro Smart!)","uuid":"62261af9-3a10-438a-ac35-12f0523faa9a","refNumber":"REF2915Q","company":{"identifier":"Allegro","name":"Allegro"},"releasedDate":"2021-08-09T12:49:26.000Z","location":{"city":"Poznań, Warszawa","country":"pl","remote":false},"industry":{"id":"internet","label":"Internet"},"department":{"id":"2572889","label":"IT -
