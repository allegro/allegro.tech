If a single strict error is found, the tool\nexits with an error, so you can be sure that all specified files are really strict (strict, strict, strict… ahh).\nHow to use it?\nInstall the typescript-strict-plugin package\nwith npm:\n\nnpm i -D typescript-strict-plugin\n\n\nor yarn:\n\nyarn add -D typescript-strict-plugin\n\n\nAdd the plugin to your tsconfig.json\n\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    //...\n    \"strict\": false,\n    \"plugins\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"typescript-strict-plugin\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nMark strict files with //@ts-strict comment\nBefore:\n\nconst name: string = null; // no error here\n\n\nAfter:\n\n// @ts-strict\n...\nconst name: string = null; // TS2322: Type ‘null’ is not assignable to type ‘string’.\n\n\nYou can also directly specify directories you want to be strict. In the following example, every file in src and test\ndirectories will be strictly checked.\n\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    //...\n    \"strict\": false,\n    \"plugins\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"typescript-strict-plugin\",\n        \"path\": [\"./src\", \"./test\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nAdd tsc-strict to your type checking package.json scripts\n\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"typecheck\": \"tsc && tsc-strict\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nOtherwise, the plugin will not work outside your IDE.\nNote: tsc-strict script uses TypeScript’s tsc under the hood, so the full type checking time in this scenario would double.\nConclusion\ntypescript-strict-plugin can improve your app’s reliability and type safety. And all that without any disadvantages except for\ncompilation time and a few comments.\nIf you’re interested in how this works under the hood, we are working on a separate post on making your own TS plugin, so stay\ntuned!","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/09/How-to-turn-on-TypeScript-strict-mode-in-specific-files.html","categories":["typescript","scrict mode","typescript plugin","code quality"],"isoDate":"2021-09-05T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"},{"title":"Splitting data that does not fit on one machine using data partitioning","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/08/splitting-data-that-does-not-fit-on-one-machine-using-data-partitioning.html","pubDate":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0200","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Tomasz Lelek"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/tomasz.lelek.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/tomasz.lelek"]},{"name":["Jon Skeet"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/jon.skeet.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/jon.skeet"]}]},"content":"<p>The following article is an excerpt from <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/software-mistakes-and-tradeoffs\">Software Mistakes and Trade-offs</a> book.\nIn real-world big data applications, the amount of data that we need to store and process can be often counted in the hundreds of terabytes or petabytes. It is not feasible to store such an amount of data on one physical node. We need a way to split that data into N data nodes.</p>\n\n<p>The technique for splitting the data is called data partitioning. There are a lot of techniques to partition your data.</p>\n\n<p>For online processing sources (like a database), you may pick some ID, for example, user-ID, and store a range of users on a dedicated node. For example, assuming that you have 1000 user IDs and 5 data nodes, the first node can store IDs from 0 to 200, the second node can store data from 201 to 400, and so on. When picking the partitioning scheme, you need to be careful not to introduce the data skew. Such a situation can occur when most of the data is produced by one or a group of IDs that belongs to the same data node. For example, let’s assume that the user ID 10 is responsible for 80% of our traffic and generates 80% of the data. Therefore, it will mean that 80% of the data is stored on the first data node, and our partitioning will not be optimal. In the worst case, this user’s amount of data may be too big to store on the given data node. It is important to note that for online processing, the partitioning is optimized for reading or writing data access patterns.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"offline-big-data-partitioning\">Offline big data partitioning</h2>\n\n<p>We will focus now on the offline, big data processing partitioning.</p>\n\n<p>For Big Data systems, we often need to store the historical data (cold data) for an “indefinite” amount of time. It is crucial to store the data for as long as we can. When the data is produced, we may not be aware of the business value that it can bring in the future. For example, we may save all user’s request data with all the HTTP headers. When the data is saved, there may be no use case for these HTTP headers. In the future, however, we may decide to build a tool that profiles our users by the type of device (Android, iOS) that they use. Such information is propagated in the HTTP headers. We can execute our new profiling logic based on the historical data because we stored it in the raw data. It is important to note here that the data was not needed for a long period.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we needed to store a lot of information and save it for later. Thus, our storage needs to contain a lot of data stored in cold storage. In Big Data applications, it often means that data is saved to a Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS). It also means that the data should be partitioned in a fairly generic way. We cannot optimize for read patterns because we cannot anticipate how those read patterns will look like.</p>\n\n<p>Because of these reasons, the most often used data partitioning scheme for big data offline processing is based on dates. Let’s assume that we have a system that saves user’s data on the /users file system path and clickstream data in the /clicks file system path. We will analyze the first data set that stores the user’s data. We are assuming that the number of records that we store is equal to 10 billion. We started collecting the data in the year 2017, and it’s been collected since then.</p>\n\n<p>The partitioning scheme that we pick is based on the date. It means that our partition identifier starts with the year. We will have 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 partitions. If we would have smaller data requirements, partitioning by year may be enough. In such a scenario, the file system path for our user’s data would be /users/2017, /users/2018, and so on. It will be analogical for clicks: /clicks/2017, /clicks/2018, and so on.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-08-10-splitting-data-that-does-not-fit-on-one-machine-using-data-partitioning/img1.png\" alt=\"Figure 1\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"four-data-partitions\">Four data partitions</h2>\n\n<p>By using this partitioning, the user’s data will have 4 partitions. It means that we can split the data into up to four physical data nodes. The first node will store the data for the year 2017, the second node for 2018, etc. Nothing prevents us from keeping all of those partitions on the same physical node when having four partitions. We may be ok with storing the data on one physical node as long as we have enough disk space. Once the disk space runs out, we can create a new physical node and move some of the partitions to the new node.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, such a partitioning scheme is too coarse-grained. Having one big partition for all year’s data is hard from both a read and write perspective. When you read such data and are interested only in events from a particular date, you need to scan the whole year’s data. It’s very inefficient and time-consuming. It is also problematic from the writing perspective because if your disk space runs out, there is no easy way to split the data further. You won’t be able to perform a successful write.</p>\n\n<p>Because of that reason, offline big data systems tend to partition the data in a more fine-grained fashion. The data is partitioned by year, month, and even day. For example, if you are writing data for the 2nd of January 2020, you will save the event into a /users/2020/01/02 partition. Such a partitioning gives you a lot of flexibility at the read side as well. If you wish to analyze events for a specific day, you can directly read the data from the partition. If you want to perform some higher-level analysis, for example, analyze the whole month’s data, you can read all partitions within a given month. The same pattern applies if you want to analyze a whole year’s data.</p>\n\n<p>To sum up, our 10 billion records will be partitioned in the following way:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-08-10-splitting-data-that-does-not-fit-on-one-machine-using-data-partitioning/img2.png\" alt=\"Figure 2\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"date-based-data-partitioning\">Date based data partitioning</h2>\n\n<p>You can see that the initial 10 billion records are partitioned into year/month, and finally, a specific date of the month. In the end, each day’s partition contains a hundred thousand records. Such an amount of data can easily fit into one machine disk space. It also means that we have 365/366 partitions per year. The upper number of data nodes on which we can partition the data is equal to the number of days * the number of years we store data. If your one-day data does not fit into one machine disk space, you can easily partition your data further by hours of the day, minutes, seconds, and so on.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"partitioning-vs-sharding\">Partitioning vs sharding</h2>\n\n<p>Assuming that we have our data partitioned by the date, we can split that data into multiple nodes. In such a scenario, we are putting a subset of all partition keys in a physical node.</p>\n\n<p>Our user’s data is partitioned into N partitions (logical shards). Let’s assume that our partition granularity is a month. In that case, the data for the year 2020 has 12 partitions that can be split horizontally into N physical nodes (physical shards). It is important to note that N is less than or equal to 12. In other words, the maximum level of physical shards is 12. This architecture pattern is called sharding.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s assume that we have three physical nodes. In that case, we can say that our user’s data for the year 2020 is partitioned into 12 partitions. Next, they are assigned to 3 shards (nodes). Each of the nodes stores 4 partitions for 2020 (12 partitions / 3 nodes = 4 partitions/node).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-08-10-splitting-data-that-does-not-fit-on-one-machine-using-data-partitioning/img1.png\" alt=\"Figure 8.6.

I think that after all this time we can safely say that this direction was correct and remained almost entirely unchanged in relation to the original idea. Still, some of the challenges foreseen in the publication soon became the reality. In this article I would like to focus on the CSS part of the whole adventure to tell you about how we manage consistency and frontend performance across over half a thousand components, and what it took us to get to where we stand today.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"new-approach--new-challenges\">New Approach — New Challenges</h3>\n\n<p>Handling all the dependencies, libraries and visual compatibility when the entire website resides in a single repository is a challenge by itself. The level of difficulty increases even more, when there are hundreds of said repositories, each managed by a different team and tooling. When in such situation, one of the things that quickly become apparent is the need for some kind of guidelines around the look of various aspects of components being developed like color scheme, spacing, fonts etc. — those are exactly the reasons why the Metrum Design System came to life.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2021-07-29-css-architecture-and-performance-of-micro-frontends/metrum-design-system.jpg\" alt=\"Metrum Design System\" title=\"Metrum Design System\" /></p>\n\n<p>In its initial form — apart from visual examples and design resources — Metrum was providing reusable PostCSS mixins that every developer could install via separate npm packages and include in the component they were working on.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-scss highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">@import</span> <span class=\"s1\">'node_modules/@metrum/button/css/mixins.css'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"nc\">.button</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">@mixin</span> <span class=\"nf\">m-button</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nl\">background-color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"no\">black</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-html highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;button</span> <span class=\"na\">class=</span><span class=\"s\">\"button\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If we try to evaluate that approach we could come up with following pros and cons:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Easy to use — install mixin and include in component’s selector;</li>\n  <li>Mixins allow for sharing visual identity between components;</li>\n  <li>Developers can use mixins in any version without depending on other parts of the page;</li>\n  <li>Every component ships with a complete set of styles.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Including mixins introduces duplication of CSS rules between components used on the same page;</li>\n  <li>More files — every component brings at least one request for its styles;</li>\n  <li>No sharing of CSS — no cache reuse between pages built from different components;</li>\n  <li>Clashing of class names within the global namespace.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary, while being very flexible and easy to use, mixins-based approach was not ideal from a performance point of view. Every time when somebody wanted to use a button, input, link etc., they would have to include a mixin for it pulling the entire set of CSS rules to their stylesheet. This resulted in our users downloading unnecessary kilobytes during the first visit while bringing no caching benefit when navigating through other pages which in turn increased rendering times. We knew we could do better.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"enter-css-modules\">Enter CSS Modules</h3>\n\n<p>After a lot of brainstorming, a decision was made that the next step should involve Metrum making use of CSS Modules. While the technical aspects and usage were changing as the adoption grew, the main principles stayed the same up to this day. Currently, whenever any developer wants to assemble a new component out of Metrum building blocks, they can install desired packages, compose styles from them and declare used classes in their markup:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-scss highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nc\">.button</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">composes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">m-button</span> <span class=\"n\">from</span> <span class=\"s1\">'@metrum/button'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"na\">composes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">m-background-color-black</span> <span class=\"n\">from</span> <span class=\"s1\">'@metrum/color'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">import</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"nx\">styles</span> <span class=\"k\">from</span> <span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">./styles.css</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">export</span> <span class=\"k\">default</span> <span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">render</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"s2\">`\n        &lt;button class=\"</span><span class=\"p\">${</span><span class=\"nx\">styles</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">button</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">\"&gt;...&lt;/button&gt;\n    `</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Thanks to the fact that all of our micro frontends run on Node.js, this approach can be used quite easily with the majority of tooling available. The only thing left to do is to collect all of the required Metrum stylesheets during render in our facade server called opbox-web and embed them on the page with the correct order. Ordering requirement is important, because we follow atomic design and more complicated components (molecules, organisms) are built using simpler ones (atoms). Lets see what all of those changes did to our list of tradeoffs:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Still easy to use — install package and compose desired classes in your component;</li>\n  <li>Sharing classes means sharing visual traits which was one of our goals;</li>\n  <li>Styles for certain module only appear once per page if used in multiple components;</li>\n  <li>Each Metrum stylesheet can be cached by the browser separately and reused on different pages;</li>\n  <li>Developers can still use packages in any version without depending on other parts of the page.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Additional logic has to be maintained that extracts needed Metrum stylesheets from components and adds them to the page once;</li>\n  <li>Above logic has to also take care of sorting so the order of styles is correct and we don’t run into problems with cascade;</li>\n  <li>Multiple versions of the same Metrum component may be needed on the page;</li>\n  <li>More and more requests have to be made as components transition to the new approach.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Judging from the upsides the transition was worth it: despite higher maintenance effort we were finally able to share common CSS code between components, the amount of downloaded data as well as render times started decreasing. Unfortunately, after some time we started to see a worrying trend related to the number of embedded stylesheets. Prior to this change, it was roughly equal to the number of components used on the page. Afterwards, with additional Metrum modules, plus the fact that multiple versions of them may be needed, we ended up with as much as around 100 requests for render-blocking CSS.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, when we bring up the issue of excessive number of requests people respond with “So what? You have HTTP/2, right?” and yes, we do. It’s true that the user agent will reuse existing connections for multiple files but the limit of concurrent streams does exist, latency is still going to affect each one of them and the compression efficiency will be worse especially for those relatively small files like ours.

I think that after all this time we can safely say that this direction was correct and remained almost entirely unchanged in relation to the original idea. Still, some of the challenges foreseen in the publication soon became the reality. In this article I would like to focus on the CSS part of the whole adventure to tell you about how we manage consistency and frontend performance across over half a thousand components, and what it took us to get to where we stand today.\nNew Approach — New Challenges\nHandling all the dependencies, libraries and visual compatibility when the entire website resides in a single repository is a challenge by itself. The level of difficulty increases even more, when there are hundreds of said repositories, each managed by a different team and tooling. When in such situation, one of the things that quickly become apparent is the need for some kind of guidelines around the look of various aspects of components being developed like color scheme, spacing, fonts etc. — those are exactly the reasons why the Metrum Design System came to life.\n\nIn its initial form — apart from visual examples and design resources — Metrum was providing reusable PostCSS mixins that every developer could install via separate npm packages and include in the component they were working on.\n\n@import 'node_modules/@metrum/button/css/mixins.css';\n\n.button {\n    @mixin m-button;\n    background-color: black;\n}\n\n\n\n<button class=\"button\"></button>\n\n\nIf we try to evaluate that approach we could come up with following pros and cons:\nPros\nEasy to use — install mixin and include in component’s selector;\nMixins allow for sharing visual identity between components;\nDevelopers can use mixins in any version without depending on other parts of the page;\nEvery component ships with a complete set of styles.\nCons\nIncluding mixins introduces duplication of CSS rules between components used on the same page;\nMore files — every component brings at least one request for its styles;\nNo sharing of CSS — no cache reuse between pages built from different components;\nClashing of class names within the global namespace.\nIn summary, while being very flexible and easy to use, mixins-based approach was not ideal from a performance point of view. Every time when somebody wanted to use a button, input, link etc., they would have to include a mixin for it pulling the entire set of CSS rules to their stylesheet. This resulted in our users downloading unnecessary kilobytes during the first visit while bringing no caching benefit when navigating through other pages which in turn increased rendering times. We knew we could do better.\nEnter CSS Modules\nAfter a lot of brainstorming, a decision was made that the next step should involve Metrum making use of CSS Modules. While the technical aspects and usage were changing as the adoption grew, the main principles stayed the same up to this day. Currently, whenever any developer wants to assemble a new component out of Metrum building blocks, they can install desired packages, compose styles from them and declare used classes in their markup:\n\n.button {\n    composes: m-button from '@metrum/button';\n    composes: m-background-color-black from '@metrum/color';\n}\n\n\n\nimport * as styles from './styles.css';\n\nexport default function render() {\n    return `\n        <button class=\"${styles.button}\">...</button>\n    `;\n}\n\n\nThanks to the fact that all of our micro frontends run on Node.js, this approach can be used quite easily with the majority of tooling available. The only thing left to do is to collect all of the required Metrum stylesheets during render in our facade server called opbox-web and embed them on the page with the correct order. Ordering requirement is important, because we follow atomic design and more complicated components (molecules, organisms) are built using simpler ones (atoms). Lets see what all of those changes did to our list of tradeoffs:\nPros\nStill easy to use — install package and compose desired classes in your component;\nSharing classes means sharing visual traits which was one of our goals;\nStyles for certain module only appear once per page if used in multiple components;\nEach Metrum stylesheet can be cached by the browser separately and reused on different pages;\nDevelopers can still use packages in any version without depending on other parts of the page.\nCons\nAdditional logic has to be maintained that extracts needed Metrum stylesheets from components and adds them to the page once;\nAbove logic has to also take care of sorting so the order of styles is correct and we don’t run into problems with cascade;\nMultiple versions of the same Metrum component may be needed on the page;\nMore and more requests have to be made as components transition to the new approach.\nJudging from the upsides the transition was worth it: despite higher maintenance effort we were finally able to share common CSS code between components, the amount of downloaded data as well as render times started decreasing. Unfortunately, after some time we started to see a worrying trend related to the number of embedded stylesheets. Prior to this change, it was roughly equal to the number of components used on the page. Afterwards, with additional Metrum modules, plus the fact that multiple versions of them may be needed, we ended up with as much as around 100 requests for render-blocking CSS.\nUsually, when we bring up the issue of excessive number of requests people respond with “So what? You have HTTP/2, right?” and yes, we do. It’s true that the user agent will reuse existing connections for multiple files but the limit of concurrent streams does exist, latency is still going to affect each one of them and the compression efficiency will be worse especially for those relatively small files like ours. We had to come up with yet another idea for improvement.\nLet the Bundle Begin\nAs I touched briefly earlier, we have the opbox-web — a place that’s already responsible for extracting, sorting and embedding Metrum dependencies. We figured that instead of adding each of them separately, we could prepare predefined bundles that would serve as replacements. We did as planned and, after deployment on 6th of July 2020, achieved 15% improvement in FCP metric time, which means that our users saw the first render of content faster by almost half a second.\n\nImprovement was satisfactory, but it came at a certain cost. From that time on we had to make sure all of the components used on a certain page share the same versions of Metrum modules supported by the bundle and I assure you, it was bothersome to say the least. Monitoring that nobody updated their dependency by accident was one thing (especially that we managed to automate it) but undergoing a process of actually wanting to do this was another. In addition, every time we failed within that area we had to bail and serve every stylesheet separately, preventing incorrect order of CSS and bringing performance to the previous low.\nPros\nCSS Modules usage stayed the same;\nFewer requests for critical resources resulted in noticeable improvement in FCP metric.\nCons\nExtra work is needed to keep Metrum packages versions aligned;\nUpdating Metrum dependencies becomes much harder as it requires synchronization between all of the components on a certain page;\nAll of the above meant that we only managed to enable this feature on the most popular of routes.\nWe knew there was going to be additional effort to maintain this solution but the performance gains outweighed the cost at that time. It took almost a year of tedious work from multiple teams to keep the look and feel of Allegro up to date with newest changes, until we came up with another idea.\nJust In Time Bundling\nIn the beginning of 2021 another idea started to form.

Sadly, taking into account that there are around 500 components, any of which can either be used as a building block of a certain page or not, gives us 2500 combinations which is way more than we can handle. Even if we optimistically assumed that each stylesheet required around 50ms to generate, it would take us roughly 5x10141 years to cover everything.
