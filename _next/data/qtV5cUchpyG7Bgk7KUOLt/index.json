Big issue is to provide these dependencies while running tests inside CI pipeline but this is completely\nanother story. In both cases, it is not trivial task. So, for the sake of simplicity we were ensuring there are no performance issues and jobs are not broken by\nrunning them on a dev environment using the production data which also took us a lot of time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"local-run\">Local run</h3>\n\n<p>Local run in our case does not mean 100% execution on the laptop: job is triggered from the local machine, but actually it has a place on the real cluster\nin Google Cloud.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Natively via Spark submit command.

However, even here, not everything is so clear as we have two services to run our\njobs and we described our considerations about them below.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%; vertical-align: top;\">\n        <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataproc\">Dataproc</a> (Hadoop under the hood which is required to run Spark). As we do not need to have it running all the time, we deployed it for each job\n        execution, luckily we again have benefited from Terraform to do it. Also we used it to spin up the network, subnetwork, router and other things that are\n        needed to run the Spark job within Dataproc, so I would generally recommend it as a useful tool to automate things in GCP. Dataproc has autoscaling\n        feature, but it requires more actions: creating autoscaling policy in GCP and integrating it into the job. Moreover, to achieve good performance we\n        needed to play a lot with Spark configuration like tuning memory on workers, choosing appropriate number of shuffle partitions, executor instances and\n        so on.\n        </td>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataflow\">Dataflow</a>. Due to its serverless nature we didn’t need to set up a cluster each time we wanted to process data. The next big advantage\n        of Dataflow is the Shuffle service, which addresses the shuffle issue on Spark executors as it moves heavy operation out of the worker virtual machine\n        to the service backend. Besides, there is autoscaling out-of-the-box, Streaming engine for streaming pipeline support. Generally, Dataflow is supposed\n        to be a self-managed platform, so less effort is required to configure it compared to Dataproc.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Dataflow wins in terms of ease of the setup. However, there is one more drawback here: limitation to run on the public cloud. It was so\nconvenient for us to profit from Dataflow services that it would be hard to find appropriate substitution for them. Furthermore, BigFlow framework\npositions itself as a Python framework for data processing pipelines on GCP. So if we want to migrate to another platform, this would enforce us to\nconfigure another runner so that we are able to run the job properly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monitoring\">Monitoring</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to the process itself, it is crucial to have an option to observe its workflow, collect metrics and have access to logs from the machines.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:50%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Familiar dashboard with Yarn metrics at our disposal - Spark UI is the same that we had in the Hadoop cluster on-premise. The inconvenience was that we\n        had to switch between different tabs in the browser. Another issue was with Spark logs UI view, as if you open it by clicking on the particular running job, you\n        can see only the part of them. The rest can be found in GCP Logger where you need to know how to build queries to fetch them. Also Dataproc does not\n        keep the history of metrics once the cluster is shut down. You need to spin up a separate Spark history server to collect them and then configure its\n        visualisation in GCP Monitoring.\n        </td>\n        <td style=\"width:50%;\">\n        Logs from workers and metrics are displayed on the same UI and are available even after the job is finished.\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: Dataflow beats Dataproc here and that is it. No comments are required.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cost\">Cost</h3>\n\n<p>Last but not least is the pricing of used GCP resources needed to process data like setting and running a cluster, storing data and queries execution in\nBigQuery, etc. Here we are most likely talking not only about the money, but also about the time. As it was basically a pilot project, we calculated the cost of\nnon-optimized jobs to see how much it is without significant tuning.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:20%;\"></th>\n        <th style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:20%;\">Cost</td>\n        <td style=\"width:80%; text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\">\n        Approximately on the same level, slightly in favour of Apache Spark\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:20%;\">Time</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">1.5h</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">1h</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: cost is almost the same, however we need to highlight that Spark job has much more space to optimize while Apache Beam job already\ncontains Dataflow optimizations out-of-the-box. For example: playing more with Spark configuration, experimenting with Dataproc workers number, etc, so\nprobably it would cost less and run faster if you know how to tune it properly.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>At the end we’d like to say that Spark Job could be more beneficial if you know it well. Additionally, Dataproc requires advanced skills close to\nthe experienced DevOps engineer to organize all necessary infrastructure. But if you do not have an engineer with deep BigData experience in your team or you\nrun out of time and you are ready to pay a little bit more for out-of-the-box features, then Apache Beam + Dataflow is your choice. Also remember even if you\npay a little bit more, it means that you are saving developers’ time spent on the Spark tweaking that may bring some value.</p>\n\n<p>Below you can find how we’d estimate entry level for skills that were necessary for us to develop using the two technologies.</p>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th style=\"width:20%;\"></th>\n        <th style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Apache Spark</th>\n        <th style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:20%;\">Programming languages</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Scala (Intermediate)</td>\n        <td rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Python (Intermediate)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">\n        Python (Basic)\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:80%; text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\">\n        SQL (depends on your data and constraints in the executed query, generally it is recommended to load only necessary data)\n        </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:20%;\" rowspan=\"8\">Technology stack</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\" rowspan=\"2\">Apache Spark (Advanced)</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Apache Beam (Intermediate)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">BigFlow (Advanced)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Google Dataproc (Intermediate)</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Google DataFlow (Intermediate) </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Google Logging (Basic)</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%;\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:40%; text-align: center;\">Terraform (Intermediate)</td>\n        <td style=\"width:40%;\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:80%; text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\">Google BigQuery (Basic)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:80%; text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\">Google Composer to schedule jobs in GCP (Basic)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td style=\"width:80%; text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\">Google Cloud Storage (Basic)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n.post img{margin: 0 auto;display: block;}\ntd {\n  vertical-align: top;\n}\n@media (max-width: 400px) {\n  table {\n    font-size: 0.8em;\n  }\n}\n@media (max-width: 350px) {\n  table {\n    font-size: 0.6em;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n\n","contentSnippet":"Some time ago, our team faced the issue of moving an existing Apache Spark job from an on-premise Hadoop cluster to public cloud.\nWhile working on the transition we came across another way to process data that is Apache Beam.

So, for the sake of simplicity we were ensuring there are no performance issues and jobs are not broken by\nrunning them on a dev environment using the production data which also took us a lot of time.\nLocal run\nLocal run in our case does not mean 100% execution on the laptop: job is triggered from the local machine, but actually it has a place on the real cluster\nin Google Cloud.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nSummary: no absolute winner here, depends on your preferences. Beside this we found Terraform to be a fine separate tool to set up a local\nenvironment for running the job and could be used for Apache Beam job as well.\nRunning on the GCP\nOnce we are done with the local development, we are good to go to the Cloud! However, even here, not everything is so clear as we have two services to run our\njobs and we described our considerations about them below.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nDataproc (Hadoop under the hood which is required to run Spark). As we do not need to have it running all the time, we deployed it for each job\n        execution, luckily we again have benefited from Terraform to do it. Also we used it to spin up the network, subnetwork, router and other things that are\n        needed to run the Spark job within Dataproc, so I would generally recommend it as a useful tool to automate things in GCP. Dataproc has autoscaling\n        feature, but it requires more actions: creating autoscaling policy in GCP and integrating it into the job. Moreover, to achieve good performance we\n        needed to play a lot with Spark configuration like tuning memory on workers, choosing appropriate number of shuffle partitions, executor instances and\n        so on.\n        \n        \n        Dataflow. Due to its serverless nature we didn’t need to set up a cluster each time we wanted to process data. The next big advantage\n        of Dataflow is the Shuffle service, which addresses the shuffle issue on Spark executors as it moves heavy operation out of the worker virtual machine\n        to the service backend. Besides, there is autoscaling out-of-the-box, Streaming engine for streaming pipeline support. Generally, Dataflow is supposed\n        to be a self-managed platform, so less effort is required to configure it compared to Dataproc.\n        \n    \nSummary: Dataflow wins in terms of ease of the setup. However, there is one more drawback here: limitation to run on the public cloud. It was so\nconvenient for us to profit from Dataflow services that it would be hard to find appropriate substitution for them. Furthermore, BigFlow framework\npositions itself as a Python framework for data processing pipelines on GCP. So if we want to migrate to another platform, this would enforce us to\nconfigure another runner so that we are able to run the job properly.\nMonitoring\nIn addition to the process itself, it is crucial to have an option to observe its workflow, collect metrics and have access to logs from the machines.\nApache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nSummary: Dataflow beats Dataproc here and that is it. No comments are required.\nCost\nLast but not least is the pricing of used GCP resources needed to process data like setting and running a cluster, storing data and queries execution in\nBigQuery, etc. Here we are most likely talking not only about the money, but also about the time. As it was basically a pilot project, we calculated the cost of\nnon-optimized jobs to see how much it is without significant tuning.\n\n        Apache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nCost\n        \n        Approximately on the same level, slightly in favour of Apache Spark\n        \n    \nTime\n        1.5h\n        1h\n    \nSummary: cost is almost the same, however we need to highlight that Spark job has much more space to optimize while Apache Beam job already\ncontains Dataflow optimizations out-of-the-box. For example: playing more with Spark configuration, experimenting with Dataproc workers number, etc, so\nprobably it would cost less and run faster if you know how to tune it properly.\nConclusion\nAt the end we’d like to say that Spark Job could be more beneficial if you know it well. Additionally, Dataproc requires advanced skills close to\nthe experienced DevOps engineer to organize all necessary infrastructure. But if you do not have an engineer with deep BigData experience in your team or you\nrun out of time and you are ready to pay a little bit more for out-of-the-box features, then Apache Beam + Dataflow is your choice. Also remember even if you\npay a little bit more, it means that you are saving developers’ time spent on the Spark tweaking that may bring some value.\nBelow you can find how we’d estimate entry level for skills that were necessary for us to develop using the two technologies.\n\n        Apache Spark\n        Apache Beam\n    \nProgramming languages\n        Scala (Intermediate)\n        Python (Intermediate)\n    \nTechnology stack\n        Apache Spark (Advanced)\n        Apache Beam (Intermediate)\n    \nBigFlow (Advanced)\n    \nGoogle Dataproc (Intermediate)\n        Google DataFlow (Intermediate) \n    \nGoogle Logging (Basic)\n        \n    \nTerraform (Intermediate)\n        \n    \nGoogle BigQuery (Basic)\n    \nGoogle Composer to schedule jobs in GCP (Basic)\n    \nGoogle Cloud Storage (Basic)\n    \n\n\n.post img{margin: 0 auto;display: block;}\ntd {\n  vertical-align: top;\n}\n@media (max-width: 400px) {\n  table {\n    font-size: 0.8em;\n  }\n}\n@media (max-width: 350px) {\n  table {\n    font-size: 0.6em;\n  }\n}","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/1-task-2-solutions-spark-or-beam.html","categories":["tech","Apache Spark","Apache Beam","BigFlow","BigData","GCP"],"isoDate":"2021-06-27T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"},{"title":"How to make context logging in Python less cumbersome","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/python-logging.html","pubDate":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0200","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Łukasz Mach"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/lukasz.mach.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/lukasz.mach"]}]},"content":"<p>This post is about the reasons behind writing a small (yet practical) library that has just been released as open-source:  <a href=\"https://github.com/allegro/logextractx\">LogExtraCtx</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-did-i-write-this-library\">Why did I write this library?</h2>\n\n<p>I’m a big fan of logging. I like to log as much extra data as possible, and I’m\nfond of <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">logging.debug</code> entries.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also a DRY approach believer. I feel strong anxiety when I see repetition in code.\nAnd my mind literally hangs when I need to do <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Ctrl-C/V</code>, even if it’s justified by\ncircumstances. In such cases I start to focus on getting rid of copy-pastes instead of\nwriting new code.</p>\n\n<p>Combining all these “passions” is not always easy. It’s hard to log everything without\nrepeating things. Even if it’s possible, it usually leads to inelegant code.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you want to log that some error occured:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'Foo happened: %s'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then so far it’s clean and easy.</p>\n\n<p>It would be nice to add some extra details though, like <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">user</code>\n(then you could search by <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">user</code> in <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/kibana\">Kibana</a>, if your logs goes there):</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'Foo happened: %s'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">extra</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'user'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">user</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                                           <span class=\"s\">'action_type'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'bar'</span><span class=\"p\">})</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Next, during debugging of a problem, you will notice that it’s not nearly enough and it’s worth\nadding some <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">logging.debug</code></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">debug</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"We're going to do SOMETHING in thread\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n             <span class=\"n\">extra</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'user'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">user</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                    <span class=\"s\">'action_type'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'bar'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                    <span class=\"s\">'thread_num'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">thread_num</span><span class=\"p\">})</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>After that you will notice that your code has <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">extra=</code> with duplicated <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">user</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">action_type</code>.\nIt’s a Bad Thing! Imagine what would happen if there was another <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">logger.debug</code>, and another?\nLots of repeated code that should be written only once…</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgflip.com/54peqd.jpg\" alt=\"I see copypastes in code\" /></p>\n\n<p>So in other words, the more details you log, the more cumbersome the code. What can we\ndo?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"method-1-dont-log-extra\">Method 1: don’t log <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">extra</code></h3>\n\n<p>It’s not what I like.

It could go like that:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">extra</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'user'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">user</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'action_type'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">'bar'</span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">debug</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"We're going to do SOMETHING in thread\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n             <span class=\"n\">extra</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nb\">dict</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">thread_num</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">thread_num</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"o\">**</span><span class=\"n\">extra</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'Foo happened: %s'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">extra</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">extra</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Quite tricky and not very elegant.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"method-3-use-logextractx\">Method 3: use <a href=\"https://github.com/allegro/logextractx\">LogExtraCtx</a></h3>\n\n<p>Before I describe the aforementioned library, let me show you a more realistic example.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following code:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">logger</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">logging</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">getLogger</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">__name__</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">send_message</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">requester</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">recipient</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nb\">str</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"nb\">bool</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"s\">\"\"\" Function send_message sends message to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">try</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">r</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">requests</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">post</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">settings</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">MSG_PROVIDER</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">json</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">'recipient'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">recipient</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">'content'</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">text</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n                          <span class=\"p\">...</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"n\">other</span> <span class=\"n\">params</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">....)</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">r</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">raise_for_status</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">except</span> <span class=\"n\">requests</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">exceptions</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">RequestException</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">e</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n        <span class=\"n\">logger</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">error</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'Sending message failed.

I like to log as much extra data as possible, and I’m\nfond of logging.debug entries.\nI’m also a DRY approach believer. I feel strong anxiety when I see repetition in code.\nAnd my mind literally hangs when I need to do Ctrl-C/V, even if it’s justified by\ncircumstances. In such cases I start to focus on getting rid of copy-pastes instead of\nwriting new code.\nCombining all these “passions” is not always easy. It’s hard to log everything without\nrepeating things. Even if it’s possible, it usually leads to inelegant code.\nFor example, if you want to log that some error occured:\n\nlogger.error('Foo happened: %s', e)\n\n\nThen so far it’s clean and easy.\nIt would be nice to add some extra details though, like user\n(then you could search by user in Kibana, if your logs goes there):\n\nlogger.error('Foo happened: %s', e, extra={'user': user,\n                                           'action_type': 'bar'})\n\n\nNext, during debugging of a problem, you will notice that it’s not nearly enough and it’s worth\nadding some logging.debug\n\nlogger.debug(\"We're going to do SOMETHING in thread\",\n             extra={'user': user,\n                    'action_type': 'bar',\n                    'thread_num': thread_num})\n\n\nAfter that you will notice that your code has extra= with duplicated user and action_type.\nIt’s a Bad Thing! Imagine what would happen if there was another logger.debug, and another?\nLots of repeated code that should be written only once…\n\nSo in other words, the more details you log, the more cumbersome the code. What can we\ndo?\nMethod 1: don’t log extra\nIt’s not what I like. I do want to log them!\nMethod 2: store extra in a variable\nIt’s what I used to do sometimes, before LogExtraCtx. It could go like that:\n\nextra = {'user': user, 'action_type': 'bar'}\n\nlogger.debug(\"We're going to do SOMETHING in thread\",\n             extra=dict(thread_num=thread_num, **extra))\n\nlogger.error('Foo happened: %s', e, extra=extra)\n\n\nQuite tricky and not very elegant.\nMethod 3: use LogExtraCtx\nBefore I describe the aforementioned library, let me show you a more realistic example.\nConsider the following code:\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n\ndef send_message(requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Function send_message sends message to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"\n    try:\n        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},\n                          ... < other params > ....)\n        r.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error('Sending message failed. Response text: \"%s\"', e,\n                     extra={  # extra data to be logged and indexed by Kibana\n                         'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                         'requester': requester,\n                         'recipient': recipient,\n                     })\n        return False\n    logger.info('Sending MSG success.',\n                extra={  # the same extra data to be logged/indexed\n                    'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                    'requester': requester,\n                    'recipient': recipient,\n                })\n    return True\n\n\nThere are two log entries, both with extra data for easy-finding in Kibana (there is a bit\nof redundancy in the code, so I already feel the desire to DRY it).\nThen I need to add additional logging:\n\nlogger.debug(\"headers=%r\", r.result.headers,\n             extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                    'requester': requester,\n                    'recipient': recipient\n                    })\n\n\nAnd then, I need even more context in every log entry:\n\nextra = {'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n         'requester': requester,\n         'recipient': recipient,\n         'user': str(request.user),\n         'environment': env_type,\n         }\n\n\nCombined all together, it becomes a big, unreadable blob of code. A very simple piece of logic has been\nspoiled by 3 log entries.\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n\ndef send_message(environment: str, requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Function send_message sends MSG to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"\n    try:\n        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},\n                          ... < other params > ....)\n        r.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        logger.error('Sending MSG failed. Response text: \"%s\"', e,\n                     extra={   # extra data to be logged and indexed by Kibana\n                         'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                         'requester': requester,\n                         'recipient': recipient,\n                         'user': str(request.user),\n                         'environment': env_type,\n                     })\n        logger.debug(\"headers=%r\", r.result.headers,\n                     extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                            'requester': requester,\n                            'recipient': recipient,\n                            'user': str(request.user),\n                            'environment': env_type,\n                            })\n        return False\n    logger.info('Sending MSG success.',\n                extra={  # the same extra data to be logged/indexed\n                    'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                    'requester': requester,\n                    'recipient': recipient,\n                    'user': str(request.user),\n                    'environment': env_type,\n                })\n    return True\n\n\nMy solution — LogExtraCtx:\nIn order to use it, just replace logging.getLogger with getLogger from logextractx.logger,\nand then create local logger with local context:\n\nfrom logextractx.logger import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n[...]\nloclogger = logger.local(extra={'DATA_IN': 'CURRENT_CONTEXT'})\n\n\nso the previous example is reduced to the following clean code:\n\nfrom logextractx.logger import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n\ndef send_message(environment: str, requester: str, recipient: str, text: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\" Function send_message sends MSG to the specified recipient.  \"\"\"\n\n    # extra data to be logged/indexed\n    loclogger = logger.local(extra={'ACTION_TYPE': 'SEND_MSG',\n                                    'requester': requester,\n                                    'recipient': recipient,\n                                    'user': str(request.user),\n                                    'environment': env_type})\n\n    try:\n        r = requests.post(settings.MSG_PROVIDER, json={'recipient': recipient, 'content': text},\n                          ... < other params > ....)\n        r.raise_for_status()\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        loclogger.error('Sending MSG failed. Response text: \"%s\"', e)\n        loclogger.debug(\"headers=%r\", r.result.headers)\n        return False\n    loclogger.info('Sending MSG success.')\n    return True\n\n\nInteresting and useful “side effect”\nUsually, it’s hard to distinguish log entries from various users. For example when you have an error in\nyour code and you find IndexError, you cannot be really sure to which request it belongs.\nOf course, you can guess, based on chronology and many other symptoms,\nbut if you have many concurrent requests, then it’s hard or even impossible to associate ERROR log\nwith previous INFO or DEBUG.\nSo it’s nice to have some kind of tracking ID (request-id), that sticks to the request,\nfollows it and is added to every log entry until the end of request processing. It’s also worth having\nsession-id attached to all requests that belong to given HTTP session.\nTo use it in your Django project, you should use the following:\nappend logextractx.middleware.LogCtxDjangoMiddleware to your MIDDLEWARE in settings:\n\n\nMIDDLEWARE = [\n    [...]\n     'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',\n    [...]\n    'logextractx.middleware.LogCtxDjangoMiddleware',\n ]\n\n\nAnd instead of logextractx.logger use logextractx.middleware:\n\n\nfrom logextractx.middleware import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n[...]\n\n\nAlso, you need to add filter into logging\n\n\n    'filters': {\n        'RidFilter': {\n            '()': 'logextractx.middleware.RidFilter'\n        }\n    }\n\n\nAnd that’s all. Now every log entry will contain request-id and session-id fields,\nwhat looks so nice in Kibana:\n\nExtra Formatter\nIf you use plain logging format, instead of Kibana + JSON formatter, then you may be interested in using\nlogextractx.formatter.ExtraFormatter. Just add following in your formatter definition (DictConfig):\n\n\n        'formatters': {\n            'simple': {\n                '()': 'logextractx.formatter.ExtraFormatter',\n                'fmt': '%(levelname)s %(asctime)s %(name)s: %(message)s [%(extras)s]'\n            }\n        }\n\n\nAnd then you will have all extra in a single log line.\nConclusion\nLogging a lot of details is good, but when it leads to breaching the DRY approach, I encourage you\nto use LogExtraCtx.\nAlso feel free to contribute — PRs are welcome.","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/python-logging.html","categories":["tech","python","logging"],"isoDate":"2021-06-16T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/python.png"},{"title":"Measuring Web Performance","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/06/measuring-web-performance.html","pubDate":"Tue, 08 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0200","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Jerzy Jelinek"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/jerzy.jelinek.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/jerzy.jelinek"]}]},"content":"<p>Some time ago we announced that Allegro passes Core Web Vitals assessment and thanks to that we were awarded in “<a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-cee/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/why-should-73-of-polish-websites-have-a-closer-look-at-their-mobile-user-experience/\" title=\"Core Web Vitals Hall of Fame\">Core Web Vitals Hall of Fame</a>”.\nIt means that Allegro is in the group of the 27% fastest websites in Polish Internet.</p>\n\n<p>In this series of articles, Webperf team and I want to tell you what our daily work has been like over the years,\nwhat we’ve optimized and what we’ve failed at, and how the perception of web performance has changed at our company.</p>\n\n<div class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 10px auto; display: flex; max-width: 550px;\"><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; width: 550px; height: 544px; display: block; flex-grow: 1;\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?creatorScreenName=allegrotech&amp;dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3R3ZWV0X2VtYmVkX2NsaWNrYWJpbGl0eV8xMjEwMiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJjb250cm9sIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH19&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1331547521139822592&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.allegro.tech%2F2021%2F06%2Fmeasuring-web-performance.html&amp;sessionId=1ab4cf28b64fcefdb722376a0651b436e188c01b&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=82e1070%3A1619632193066&amp;width=550px\" data-tweet-id=\"1331547521139822592\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\n\n<p>Our path to a quite fast page (we’re still hoping for more) was winding, bumpy, more than once ended in a dead end and forced us to rethink our solutions.\nWe want to show that there is no magical <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">{ perf: true }</code> option and that some things you just have to figure out by trial and error.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"beginnings\">Beginnings</h2>\n\n<p>It all started with a group of enthusiasts concerned about the poor performance of <a href=\"https://allegro.pl\" title=\"Allegro.pl\">Allegro</a> and the lack of actions to improve it.\nTheir grassroots initiative was appreciated and the core of the technical team (Webperf) was formed.\nThere was one major problem — it is relatively easy to make micro-optimizations in the code of one component,\nhowever, it is much more difficult to push through a major change involving different teams or business areas.\nThe company needed to know how the change would affect not only performance but also the business.\nAt that time there were many success stories from various companies on the internet about how improvements in loading speed had impacted their business results.\nHowever, at Allegro, we had never seen correlation between performance and business.

It allows one to set realistic financial goals for the next quarters, evaluate impact of business decisions, and prepare adequate resources for what is coming.</p>\n\n<p>Yet, many companies struggle with efficient and accurate revenue forecasting. For most of them the task still rests on the financial department’s shoulders, performing manual analyses in Excel, lacking data science know-how, and relying on a set of arbitrary assumptions concerning the future. This process is often inefficient and prone to error, making it hard to distinguish trend-based patterns from manual overrides. In the end, the forecasts often turn out to be inaccurate, but it is difficult to diagnose the source of divergence - was it the fault of the model itself, wrong business assumptions, or perhaps unusual circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>In order to overcome this problem, we decided to develop an AI tool which would allow us to forecast Allegro’s GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) based on a set of business inputs defined by the financial team. The purpose of the tool was twofold: to create automatic, monthly forecasts, and to enable creating scenarios with different input values. Examples of such inputs would be the costs of online advertising or the number of users enrolled in the loyalty program (Allegro Smart!).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> analysis and graphs presented in article are based on artificial data</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"approach\">Approach</h2>\n\n<p>We named our project domino after Marvel’s universe foreseer-heroine Domino, but the name reflects also how the model is executed.</p>\n\n<p>The model works as a graph of dependencies where each element is either a cause or effect of other steps (in the technical nomenclature known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph\">DAG</a>). Let’s go through an artificial example. Below you can find a diagram of the model. In the training phase we need to provide historical data for every node in the graph, i.e. we need to know actual online advertising spending (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-click\">PPC</a>), important holidays, and actual number of paid and organic visits to be able to accurately model the relationship between these variables.<img src=\"/img/articles/2021-05-21-domino-financial-forecasting-in-the-age-of-global-pandemic/01-approach.png\" alt=\"diagram\" /></p>\n\n<p>During the prediction phase, we only need actual data for violet nodes. These nodes usually represent our key business assumptions which are reflected in the company’s yearly budget. Next, our goal is to recreate all the succeeding values. Some of these subsequent steps will be just arithmetic operations like adding, summing, or applying logarithms (yellow and red). Other steps, here represented with blue nodes, may be Machine Learning models (e.g. <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/prophet/\">Facebook’s Prophet</a>). They can learn non-trivial effects like seasonalities, trends, holidays, and the influence of the preceding yellow nodes (i.e. explanatory variables).</p>\n\n<p>You may wonder why we bothered with creation of such a complex graph of dependencies instead of making a single model taking all the business inputs as explanatory variables and returning future GMV values as the output. It’s what we want to model in the end, right? Why are we concerned with reconstructing the values of organic or paid traffic along the way? Well, we found out that following business logic yields much better results than inserting all the inputs into a huge single pot. Not only were the results less accurate in the latter case, but also the impact of explanatory variables on GMV was often not clearly distinguishable or even misleading. Instead, we recreated the business scheme by creating and training specialized models to reconstruct all the intermediate steps (e.g. predicting the number of paid visits) and merging their outputs with arithmetic operations or other models. However, remember that this approach comes at a cost! Using many steps in the modeling process may be both a blessing and a curse, since you need to train and maintain multiple models simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of this approach is that it allows us to capture very sophisticated non-linear relationships between inputs and the final target variable (GMV in our case). Following the business logic allows us to verify these non-trivial assumptions at each step.</p>\n\n<p>Another advantage of this approach is that every model can be fitted separately with any model class you want. Having tested a few alternatives, we’ve chosen the Prophet library, but potentially any ML algorithm could be used (e.g. ARIMA, Gradient Boosting Trees, or Artificial Neural Networks).</p>\n\n<p>A disadvantage is that the error in prediction propagates downstream the graph. So, if we make a mistake in a prediction in an early step, it will influence all the models and transformations dependent on it. The issue can be mitigated by creating accurate models at each step of the process.</p>\n\n<p>Another slight disadvantage is that our Domino of models is not intrinsically interpretable (as most of the modern model classes). You have to use some post hoc methods to gather information on how the model does process data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"technical-implementation\">Technical implementation</h2>\n\n<p>To develop and iterate over the DAG-type model we had to implement a custom Python framework. It allows for training and running models as well as arithmetic transformations in a predefined order.</p>\n\n<p>The implementation allows us to utilize various model frameworks like Facebook’s Prophet, any Scikit-learn’s regressor, or an Artificial NN. For operational purposes, MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) can be easily calculated for each model in the graph, as well as for the whole DAG (again, the errors propagate downstream).</p>\n\n<p>Below you can see how the above DAG can be implemented.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span

It is also helpful to compare the predictions vs observed values for the same period of the previous year.

It allows one to set realistic financial goals for the next quarters, evaluate impact of business decisions, and prepare adequate resources for what is coming.\nYet, many companies struggle with efficient and accurate revenue forecasting. For most of them the task still rests on the financial department’s shoulders, performing manual analyses in Excel, lacking data science know-how, and relying on a set of arbitrary assumptions concerning the future. This process is often inefficient and prone to error, making it hard to distinguish trend-based patterns from manual overrides. In the end, the forecasts often turn out to be inaccurate, but it is difficult to diagnose the source of divergence - was it the fault of the model itself, wrong business assumptions, or perhaps unusual circumstances.\nIn order to overcome this problem, we decided to develop an AI tool which would allow us to forecast Allegro’s GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) based on a set of business inputs defined by the financial team. The purpose of the tool was twofold: to create automatic, monthly forecasts, and to enable creating scenarios with different input values. Examples of such inputs would be the costs of online advertising or the number of users enrolled in the loyalty program (Allegro Smart!).\nDisclaimer: analysis and graphs presented in article are based on artificial data\nApproach\nWe named our project domino after Marvel’s universe foreseer-heroine Domino, but the name reflects also how the model is executed.\nThe model works as a graph of dependencies where each element is either a cause or effect of other steps (in the technical nomenclature known as DAG). Let’s go through an artificial example. Below you can find a diagram of the model. In the training phase we need to provide historical data for every node in the graph, i.e. we need to know actual online advertising spending (PPC), important holidays, and actual number of paid and organic visits to be able to accurately model the relationship between these variables.\nDuring the prediction phase, we only need actual data for violet nodes. These nodes usually represent our key business assumptions which are reflected in the company’s yearly budget. Next, our goal is to recreate all the succeeding values. Some of these subsequent steps will be just arithmetic operations like adding, summing, or applying logarithms (yellow and red). Other steps, here represented with blue nodes, may be Machine Learning models (e.g. Facebook’s Prophet). They can learn non-trivial effects like seasonalities, trends, holidays, and the influence of the preceding yellow nodes (i.e. explanatory variables).\nYou may wonder why we bothered with creation of such a complex graph of dependencies instead of making a single model taking all the business inputs as explanatory variables and returning future GMV values as the output. It’s what we want to model in the end, right? Why are we concerned with reconstructing the values of organic or paid traffic along the way? Well, we found out that following business logic yields much better results than inserting all the inputs into a huge single pot. Not only were the results less accurate in the latter case, but also the impact of explanatory variables on GMV was often not clearly distinguishable or even misleading. Instead, we recreated the business scheme by creating and training specialized models to reconstruct all the intermediate steps (e.g. predicting the number of paid visits) and merging their outputs with arithmetic operations or other models. However, remember that this approach comes at a cost! Using many steps in the modeling process may be both a blessing and a curse, since you need to train and maintain multiple models simultaneously.\nOne of the biggest advantages of this approach is that it allows us to capture very sophisticated non-linear relationships between inputs and the final target variable (GMV in our case). Following the business logic allows us to verify these non-trivial assumptions at each step.\nAnother advantage of this approach is that every model can be fitted separately with any model class you want. Having tested a few alternatives, we’ve chosen the Prophet library, but potentially any ML algorithm could be used (e.g. ARIMA, Gradient Boosting Trees, or Artificial Neural Networks).\nA disadvantage is that the error in prediction propagates downstream the graph. So, if we make a mistake in a prediction in an early step, it will influence all the models and transformations dependent on it. The issue can be mitigated by creating accurate models at each step of the process.\nAnother slight disadvantage is that our Domino of models is not intrinsically interpretable (as most of the modern model classes). You have to use some post hoc methods to gather information on how the model does process data.\nTechnical implementation\nTo develop and iterate over the DAG-type model we had to implement a custom Python framework. It allows for training and running models as well as arithmetic transformations in a predefined order.\nThe implementation allows us to utilize various model frameworks like Facebook’s Prophet, any Scikit-learn’s regressor, or an Artificial NN. For operational purposes, MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) can be easily calculated for each model in the graph, as well as for the whole DAG (again, the errors propagate downstream).\nBelow you can see how the above DAG can be implemented.\n\nfrom domino.pipeline import Pipeline, Model, Transformer, Combinator\nfrom fbprophet import Prophet\n\ndag = Pipeline(input_list=['ppc_cost', 'smart_users'])\n\ndag.add_step(step=Transformer(base_var='ppc_cost',\n                             target_variable='ppc_cost_ln',\n                             operation_name='ln'),\n             step_name='transformer1')\n\ndag.add_step(step=Transformer(base_var='smart_users',\n                             target_variable='smart_users_add1',\n                             operation_name='add1'),\n             step_name='transformer2')\n\ndag.add_step(step=Transformer(base_var='smart_users_add1',\n                             target_variable='smart_users_add1_ln',\n                             operation_name='ln'),\n             step_name='transformer3')\n\ndag.add_step(step=Model(model=Prophet(),\n                  target_variable='paid_visits',\n                  explanatory_variables=['ppc_cost_ln']),\n         step_name='model1')\n\ndag.add_step(step=Model(model=Prophet(),\n                  target_variable='non_paid_visits',\n                  explanatory_variables=['smart_users_add1_ln']),\n             step_name='model2')\n\ndag.add_step(step=Combinator(base_var1='paid_visits',\n                            base_var2='non_paid_visits',\n                            target_variable='all_visits',\n                            operation_name='add'),\n             step_name='combination')\n\n\nNow we can use the dag object as a single model.\n\ndag.fit(df_train)\npredictions = dag.predict(df_test)\n\n\nTo understand what’s happening inside the DAG, we implemented two methods of calculating MAPE on every step:\n\ndag.calculate_mape_for_models(x=df_test)\ndag.calculate_mape_for_dag(x=df_test)\n\n\nThey both return dictionaries of model-MAPE pairs. The calculate_mape_for_model method checks each model separately, and calculate_mape_for_dag takes into account the errors propagating from preceding steps. These are examples of results:\n\nmodels_mape = {\n   'transformer1': 0.0,\n   'transformer2': 0.0,\n   'transformer3': 0.0,\n   'model1': 0.1,\n   'model2': 0.05,\n   'combination': 0.0\n}\n\ndag_mape = {\n   'transformer1': 0.0,\n   'transformer2': 0.0,\n   'transformer3': 0.0,\n   'model1': 0.1,\n   'model2': 0.05,\n   'combination': 0.09\n}\n\n\nNote that the combination step has MAPE equal to zero in models_mape and a positive one in dag_mape. That’s because it does not generate any error, as it’s an arithmetic operation, but it can propagate errors from previous steps.\nLast but not least, there is an explainability method calculate_variable_impact that helps to evaluate how changes in initial inputs impact the subsequent steps in the graph. For example, we can check what is going to happen if we decrease PPC costs by 10% and increase the number of Smart users by 5%.\n\ndag.calculate_variable_impact(x=df_test,\n                              variables_list=['ppc_cost', 'smart_users'],\n                              variables_multiplier_list=[0.9, 1.05],\n                              diff_type='relative')\n\n\nThe percent change will be calculated on every node, i.e. smart_users_add1_ln, paid_visits, and all_visits. We will be able to evaluate how such changes affect not only the GMV, but also all intermediary KPIs.\nFacebook’s Prophet\nHaving tested various modelling techniques, we chose the forecasting procedure offered by Facebook’s Prophet library (https://facebook.github.io/prophet/).

Given that we worked on the tool during summer 2020, we were forced to use quite a non-standard approach to hyperparameter tuning and model testing (e.g. to maximize the length of the training period, so that it includes at least a month of the data showing post-COVID comeback to a new normal).\nIn the long run, we expect that the process will stabilize and we’ll be able to conduct the following adjustment procedure each month: training all the models using the parameters set in the previous month, testing them on the last 2 months of observed data, evaluating monthly and daily MAPE. When forecast errors in GMV prediction or any intermediate model are too large, we scrutinize the graphs of observed vs forecasted values. It is also helpful to compare the predictions vs observed values for the same period of the previous year. This step allows us to verify whether there are any seasonalities or patterns that were not detected by the tuned model. We can fine-tune the models either manually, or using the automatic hyperparameter optimization framework.\nHyperparameter tuning using Optuna (https://optuna.org/), half a year’s worth of data and expanding window approach (see visualisation below). This means that we will fine-tune our models using 6 sets of validation datasets, each consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 months. The Optuna framework will suggest parameters that minimize the average of MAPE over these datasets.\nTesting the tuned models on 2 last months of observed data, measuring MAPE on the forecasted vs observed values of GMV, as well as on all intermediate models.\nIf any of the MAPE is not satisfactory, again scrutinizing the graphs and fine-tuning the models manually.\nOnce we are satisfied with the results, we always check if the changes made to the models do not result in some explanatory variables having unexpected signs of impact on GMV.\nDespite the changes in time series, we are expecting that in the long run fewer and fewer tweaks to the models will be necessary, and less work will be required from the analysts to maintain the tool.\nUser interface\nTo make the model easily accessible by business users, an interactive application was prepared. The user has default inputs set for upcoming months. They can change their values and get model predictions by clicking the “RUN SCENARIO” button. The predictions can be seen in daily, weekly and monthly granularities. If the user chooses to, they can export the predictions in CSV format. You can find an anonymised print screen of the tool below.\n\nSummary\nAs a result of the project, we developed a solution providing incredible business value. The main features of the tool are:\nGreat forecast accuracy - we managed to get below 2% MAPE\nStability - the structure of the model remains the same and the inputs have the same impact direction over time\nResponsiveness - the forecasts change with changes in the business inputs\nInterpretation - though the model is not intrinsically interpretable, we developed methods to check how well it works\nInteractive UI - stakeholders can experiment with various business scenarios online\nDomino proved its effectiveness in hard and demanding times while giving us a lot of practical knowledge related to modeling of such a complex business metric. And, we already started using these lessons in new upcoming projects.","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2021/05/domino-financial-forecasting-in-the-age-of-global-pandemic.html","categories":["tech"],"isoDate":"2021-05-20T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"}],"jobs":[{"id":"743999759624912","name":"Software Engineer (Node.js) -
