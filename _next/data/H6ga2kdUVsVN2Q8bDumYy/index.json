While it can be argued that in many situations it is simply\ncheaper to add another instance of the service than to engage a developer who will work tirelessly to diagnose\nand optimize performance problems, the problem will persist and intensify as the business and its requirements grow.</p>\n\n<p>A similar situation arises with databases. We often store huge amounts of data for auditing or historical purposes.\nWhile the cost of maintaining such databases is negligible at a small scale,\nover time it can become a notable burden on our budget.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to talk about such a case and how we managed to reduce the cost of maintaining a database nearly 30-fold.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>As the amount of data grows, the need for scaling arises. In the case of <strong>Azure</strong> services, scaling also has its <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/purchasing-models?view=azuresql\">limitations</a>.\nIt is not always possible to infinitely increase the available disk space without scaling other resources (CPU, RAM, I/O).\nIn our case, this limit became apparent when we exceeded 1TB of data. Our database was based on the vCore model,\nwhere we used <strong>4 vCores</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this number of vCores limited the available disk space to <strong>1TB</strong>. Due to the increase in the number of users\nand the demand for disk space, we needed more resources. We continued to scale up, adding not only more disk resources\nbut also computational resources (I will mention that at this point we reached a scale of <strong>3TB</strong> of data, which requires\nat least <strong>12 vCores</strong>). At some point, the cost of maintaining the database amounted to several thousand euros.\nThis prompted us to look for solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Comparing the cost of storing substantial amounts of data within <strong>Azure SQL</strong> and <strong>Storage Account</strong>\n(especially blobs in the <strong>archive</strong> tier), we concluded that we could achieve significant cost reduction\nby archiving old/unused data and placing it in a cost-optimized container.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monthly-cost-of-storing-3tb-of-data\">Monthly cost of storing 3TB of data</h3>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Azure SQL 12vCore 3TB</th>\n    <th>Storage Account Archive tier</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>$2,876.18</td>\n    <td>$31.12</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"analysis\">Analysis</h2>\n<p>After some investigation, It turned out that significant part of data could be safely archived,\nwhich would certainly provide\npotential savings and eliminate the problem of an overgrown database. Most of this data was actually historical.</p>\n\n<p>We implemented a solution that allows for much more scalable data archiving\nby asynchronously loading data into the warehouse.\nHowever, data from before the implementation of aforementioned solution were still generating considerable storage costs.</p>\n\n<p>The idea seemed simple both in concept and execution. However, we immediately encountered several problems.\nExporting such massive amounts of data is a time-consuming process and puts a heavy load on the database\ncausing responsiveness issues.</p>\n\n<p>Dealing with a production system, we could not reduce the reliability and availability of services.\nIn addition, the export functionality offered by the Azure portal is limited to databases up to <strong>200GB</strong> in size,\nwhich meant that we had to look for another solution.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"action-plan\">Action plan</h2>\n<h3 id=\"concept\">Concept</h3>\n<p>As it turned out, there are ways to export even huge databases. After some investigation,\nwe found the <strong>SQL Package</strong> tool.\nIt provides <strong>export</strong> option and is great for solving aforementioned problem. It is able to produce a <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">bacpac</code>\nfile that contains highly compressed content of the database.\nThe tool also allows you to restore data at any time using the <strong>import</strong> operation,\nif there is ever a need to review it, for example for audit purposes.</p>\n\n<p>The next step is to copy the file to the container in the Storage Account using the <strong>AzCopy</strong> tool and ensure\nthat it is stored in the <strong>ARCHIVE</strong> tier, what will massively reduce the costs of maintaining it.</p>\n\n<p>The final stage is to delete unnecessary data from the database, then <strong>SHRINK</strong> it, what will reduce database resources.</p>\n<h3 id=\"script-and-tools\">Script and tools</h3>\n<p>To export and archive the database, we used two tools provided by Microsoft: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage?view=sql-server-ver16\">SQL Package</a>\nand <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10\">AzCopy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After analyzing their documentation, we prepared the appropriate procedure taking\ninto account performance and operation duration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"infrastructure\">Infrastructure</h3>\n<p>Due to the fact that the export and upload process to the Storage Account container with this amount of data may take\na long time, we decided to set up a temporary <strong>VM</strong> with the accelerated networking option, which served us\nto execute all required scripts.

Thanks to meeting this condition,\nit was possible to successfully connect to the database and perform the export operation.</p>\n\n<p>The virtual machine turned out to be moderately priced, as all performed operations were not computationally demanding\n(both CPU and RAM usage were low), what allowed us to use a very resource-efficient machine.

The ONLINE option is particularly noteworthy,\nas it ensures that existing indexes and tables will not be blocked, what is an important issue in the case\nof continuous operation of our services.\n\nALTER INDEX ALL ON dbo.TableName REBUILD WITH\n(FILLFACTOR = 80, SORT_IN_TEMPDB = ON, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = ON, ONLINE = ON);\n\n\nIt should also be noted that this can be a time-consuming operation, but as a result of its execution,\nthe indexes returned to the required consistency level, reaching a level of fragmentation close to 0%.\nThe response time and resource consumption charts of the database also returned to the values closer to the initial ones.\n\n\nConclusion\nAfter performing all of the described actions, we achieved a reduction\nin the size of the database from over 3TB to slightly below 100GB.\nBy lowering the required disk space, we could also significantly reduce the computational resources of the database,\ngenerating further serious savings.\nBefore performing all the operations,\nthe monthly cost of maintaining the database was close to €3000.\nBy switching from a database based on a 12 vCore and 3TB model to a Standard DTU with 100 units and 150GB\nwe managed to cut our monthly spendings to mere €125.\nAfter all, our effort paid off.\n\nThe above example demonstrates how to greatly reduce infrastructure costs. Of course,\nthe described procedure will apply to specific cases and data characteristics.\nHowever, if you have a similar problem, I think it is worth considering this approach.","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/07/save-money-on-large-database.html","categories":["tech","azure","sql","saving","cloud"],"isoDate":"2023-07-09T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"},{"title":"Debugging hangs - piecing together why nothing happens","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/05/debugging-hangs.html","pubDate":"Wed, 31 May 2023 00:00:00 +0200","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Łukasz Rokita"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/lukasz.rokita.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/lukasz.rokita"]}]},"content":"<p>As a part of a broader initiative of refreshing Allegro platform, we are upgrading our internal libraries to Spring Boot 3.0 and Java 17.\nThe task is daunting and filled with challenges,\nhowever overall progress is steady and thanks to the modular nature of our code it should end in finite time.\nEveryone who has performed such an upgrade knows that you need to expect the unexpected and at the end of the day prepare for lots of debugging.\nNo amount of migration guide would prepare you for what’s coming in the field.\nIn the words of Donald Rumsfeld there are unknown unknowns and we need to be equipped with the tools to uncover these unknowns and patch them up.\nIn this blog post I’d like to walk you through a process that should show where the application hangs,\nalthough there seems to be nothing wrong with it. I will also show that you don’t always know what code you have – problem known as dependecy hell,\nplace we got quite cosy in during this upgrade.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-change\">The change</h2>\n<p>Note that we keep versions as separate key–value pairs in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">build.gradle</code> files and reference them in dependencies by key.\nUpdating often means a single line change. The upgrade is trivial and git diff looks like this.</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>ext.versions = [\n-        spring         : '5.3.24',\n-        spock          : '2.3-groovy-3.0',\n-        groovy         : '3.0.14',\n]\n\next.versions = [\n+        spring         : '6.0.5',\n+        spock          : '2.4-M1-groovy-4.0',\n+        groovy         : '4.0.9',\n]\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Nothing much happens. We upgrade Spring and since there are some problems with Spock not working well with the newest Spring\nwe need to upgrade it as well, along with Groovy. This is the easy part.\nNow we run the tests and expect to be either elated with the sight of a successful build or greeted with descriptive error messages\nthat help us quickly patch the issue. Nobody expects anything and in this case this is an unknown unknown.</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>97% EXECUTING [15m 55s]\n&gt; :platform-libraries-webclient:integrationTest &gt; 1 test completed, 1 failed\n&gt; :platform-libraries-webclient:integrationTest &gt; Executing test pl.allegro....WebClientContextContainerInterceptorSpec\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>After 15 minutes we expect the process to end. A quick cross-check with the master branch confirms that tests run and execute in less than a minute.\nSomething is wrong and it’s on us. However, no error is presented. Adding logging does not help, nothing streams to standard output.\nSomething hangs and refuses to budge. When that happenes there is only one way to inspect what is going on and\nthat is to pop the hood open and look into JVM to see what the threads are doing or where they are slacking.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"thread-theory\">Thread theory</h2>\n\n<p>Let’s interrupt this story with a short summary of threading in JVM. You can skip this chapter if you are familiar with the topic.\nAs the priceless book Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz et al. teaches us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Threads may block, or pause, for several reasons: waiting for I/O completion, waiting to acquire a lock,\nwaiting to wake up from Thread.sleep, or waiting for the result of a computation in another thread.\nWhen a thread blocks, it is usually suspended and placed in one of the blocked thread states\n(BLOCKED, WAITING, or TIMED_WAITING). (…) blocked thread must wait for an event beyond its control before it can proceed”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds exactly like the situation we are in. So there is hope. Let’s educate ourselves further.\nAnother excerpt that would prove insightful reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“(…) tasks can block for exteded periods of time, even if deadlock is not a possibility.\n(…) One technique that can mitigate the ill effects of long–running tasks is for tasks to use timed resource waits instead of\nunbound waits.”\nThis seems like an answer to our woes. However, two mysteries remain.\nWhere to put the timeout? What the thread is waiting for? To answer these questions we need to inspect the threads in the JVM itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-investigation\">The investigation</h2>\n<p>At this point we did two things. First we pushed our code to a branch.\nAfter all at any moment our laptops could burst into flames and all the work would go to waste.\nThe remote CI confirmed our suspicion since it also hung. The problem was real and not only confined to the local machine.\nThe second thing is to scout for the offending thread. This is easy with the help of some JDK binaries:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>jps -lv | grep platform-libraries\n38983 worker.org.gradle.process.internal.worker.GradleWorkerMain -Dorg.gradle.internal.worker.tmpdir=/path/to/code/platform-libraries/platform-libraries-webclient/build/tmp/integrationTest/work -Dorg.gradle.native=false -Xmx512m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>So we have the a lvmid – local JVM identifier, which will help us locate the offending thread in jconsole.\nIn the screen below we can see that the thread waits on <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Mono.block()</code> which is left unbounded in a happy path scenario.\nWell, we are in the worst case so first of all we add a simple timeout <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">Mono.block(Duration.ofSeconds(10))</code>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-05-31-debugging-hangs/jconsole.png\" alt=\"jconsole\" /></p>\n\n<p>This fails our tests and for the first time the error appears:</p>\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre

I will also show that you don’t always know what code you have – problem known as dependecy hell,\nplace we got quite cosy in during this upgrade.\nThe change\nNote that we keep versions as separate key–value pairs in build.gradle files and reference them in dependencies by key.\nUpdating often means a single line change. The upgrade is trivial and git diff looks like this.\n\next.versions = [\n-        spring         : '5.3.24',\n-        spock          : '2.3-groovy-3.0',\n-        groovy         : '3.0.14',\n]\n\next.versions = [\n+        spring         : '6.0.5',\n+        spock          : '2.4-M1-groovy-4.0',\n+        groovy         : '4.0.9',\n]\n\n\nNothing much happens. We upgrade Spring and since there are some problems with Spock not working well with the newest Spring\nwe need to upgrade it as well, along with Groovy. This is the easy part.\nNow we run the tests and expect to be either elated with the sight of a successful build or greeted with descriptive error messages\nthat help us quickly patch the issue. Nobody expects anything and in this case this is an unknown unknown.\n\n97% EXECUTING [15m 55s]\n> :platform-libraries-webclient:integrationTest > 1 test completed, 1 failed\n> :platform-libraries-webclient:integrationTest > Executing test pl.allegro....WebClientContextContainerInterceptorSpec\n\n\nAfter 15 minutes we expect the process to end. A quick cross-check with the master branch confirms that tests run and execute in less than a minute.\nSomething is wrong and it’s on us. However, no error is presented. Adding logging does not help, nothing streams to standard output.\nSomething hangs and refuses to budge. When that happenes there is only one way to inspect what is going on and\nthat is to pop the hood open and look into JVM to see what the threads are doing or where they are slacking.\nThread theory\nLet’s interrupt this story with a short summary of threading in JVM. You can skip this chapter if you are familiar with the topic.\nAs the priceless book Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz et al. teaches us:\n“Threads may block, or pause, for several reasons: waiting for I/O completion, waiting to acquire a lock,\nwaiting to wake up from Thread.sleep, or waiting for the result of a computation in another thread.\nWhen a thread blocks, it is usually suspended and placed in one of the blocked thread states\n(BLOCKED, WAITING, or TIMED_WAITING). (…) blocked thread must wait for an event beyond its control before it can proceed”.\nThis sounds exactly like the situation we are in. So there is hope. Let’s educate ourselves further.\nAnother excerpt that would prove insightful reads as follows:\n“(…) tasks can block for exteded periods of time, even if deadlock is not a possibility.\n(…) One technique that can mitigate the ill effects of long–running tasks is for tasks to use timed resource waits instead of\nunbound waits.”\nThis seems like an answer to our woes. However, two mysteries remain.\nWhere to put the timeout? What the thread is waiting for? To answer these questions we need to inspect the threads in the JVM itself.\nThe investigation\nAt this point we did two things. First we pushed our code to a branch.\nAfter all at any moment our laptops could burst into flames and all the work would go to waste.\nThe remote CI confirmed our suspicion since it also hung. The problem was real and not only confined to the local machine.\nThe second thing is to scout for the offending thread. This is easy with the help of some JDK binaries:\n\njps -lv | grep platform-libraries\n38983 worker.org.gradle.process.internal.worker.GradleWorkerMain -Dorg.gradle.internal.worker.tmpdir=/path/to/code/platform-libraries/platform-libraries-webclient/build/tmp/integrationTest/work -Dorg.gradle.native=false -Xmx512m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8\n\n\nSo we have the a lvmid – local JVM identifier, which will help us locate the offending thread in jconsole.\nIn the screen below we can see that the thread waits on Mono.block() which is left unbounded in a happy path scenario.\nWell, we are in the worst case so first of all we add a simple timeout Mono.block(Duration.ofSeconds(10)).\n\nThis fails our tests and for the first time the error appears:\n\n\t08:13:39.556 [Test worker] WARN reactor.core.Exceptions - throwIfFatal detected a jvm fatal exception, which is thrown and logged below:\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError:

It involves cases of incorrectly labelled training data. For example, let’s say that\nwe want to train a classification model to distinguish cats from dogs. For that purpose, we compose a training\ndataset with images labelled as either cat or dog. The labelling process is usually performed by human annotators,\nwho almost certainly produce some labelling errors. Unfortunately, human annotators can be confused by poor image\nquality, ambiguous image contents, or simply click the wrong item. As such, we inevitably end up with a dataset\nwhere some percentage of cats are labelled as dogs and vice versa (<a href=\"#figure1\"><strong>Figure 1</strong></a>).</p>\n\n<figure style=\"display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\">\n    <a id=\"figure1\"></a>\n    <img alt=\"Cats and dogs are equally nice.\" src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-18-learning-from-noisy-data/figure1-label-noise-example.png\" style=\"width:80%;margin-bottom:10px\" />\n    <p style=\"width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"> <b>Figure 1. An example of label noise in a binary classification dataset.</b> Some images in both categories were mislabelled by human annotators, which introduces noise to the training dataset. </p>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Consequently, the model trained with such data learns partially wrong associations, which then can lead to incorrect\npredictions for new images. The more label noise we have, the more we confuse the model during training. We can\nmeasure this by evaluating the classification error on a held-out test dataset (<a href=\"#figure2\"><strong>Figure 2</strong></a>). It is clear\nthat for high noise levels, it is very hard to recover the true training signal from the corrupted training data.</p>\n\n<figure style=\"display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\">\n    <a id=\"figure2\"></a>\n    <img alt=\"Oh no, please, not the noise!\" src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-18-learning-from-noisy-data/figure2-test-accuracy.png\" style=\"width:70%;margin-bottom:10px\" />\n    <p style=\"width:70%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"><b> Figure 2. Test accuracy as a function of label noise percentage. </b> The X axis indicates the ratio of mislabelled to correctly labelled examples. The dataset used here was ImageNet, corrupted with synthetic label noise. Image source: <sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n</figure>\n\n<p>How can this problem be mitigated? One approach is to simply put more effort into the labelling process — we can let\nmultiple annotators label each data point and then evaluate the cross-annotator agreement. With enough time and effort,\nwe hope to obtain a dataset free of label noise. However, in practice this approach is rarely feasible due to large\nvolumes of training data and the need for efficient turnaround of machine learning projects. Consequently, we need\na different approach for handling corrupted training data, <em>i.e.</em> ML models robust to label noise.</p>\n\n<p>In the context of this blog post, we define robustness as the model’s ability to efficiently learn in the presence\nof corrupted training data. In other words, a robust model can recover the correct training signal and ignore\nthe noise, so that it does not overfit to the corrupted traning set and can generalise during prediction. A major\nchallenge in this regard is the difficulty to estimate the proportion of label noise in real-world data. As such,\nrobust models are expected to handle varying amounts of label noise.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-train-a-robust-classifier\">How to train a robust classifier?</h2>\n\n<p>We can improve the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) with a few tips and tricks presented in the recent\nliterature on <em>Learning from Noisy Data</em>. In general, there are three approaches to boosting the model’s resistance\nto noisy labels (<a href=\"#figure3\"><strong>Figure 3</strong></a>):</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Robust loss function</strong> boosting the training dynamics in the presence of noise.</li>\n  <li><strong>Implicit regularisation</strong> of the network aiming at decreasing the impact of noisy labels.</li>\n  <li><strong>Filtration of noisy data samples</strong> during the training or at the pre-training stage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<figure style=\"display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\">\n    <a id=\"figure3\"></a>\n    <img alt=\"Flat-topped pyramids are better than sharp-topped ones.\" src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-18-learning-from-noisy-data/figure3-robustness-strategies.png\" style=\"width:80%;margin-bottom:10px\" />\n    <p style=\"width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"><b> Figure 3.

Clean labels should be easy to learn, while corrupted labels\nwould appear as difficult, resulting in a high per-sample loss.</p>\n\n<p>SPL proposes to exclude some predefined ratio of examples from the batch depending on their per-sample loss values\n(<a href=\"#figure4\"><strong>Figure 4a</strong></a>). Usually, the ratio is set as the estimated noise level in the dataset.</p>\n\n<figure style=\"display:block;float:none;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\">\n    <a id=\"figure4\"></a>\n    <img alt=\"PRL makes everything equal.\" src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-18-learning-from-noisy-data/figure4-loss-filtration.png\" style=\"width:80%;margin-bottom:10px\" />\n    <p style=\"width:80%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"> <b> Figure 4.

The rest of the logic is the same as in SPL.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"clipped-cross-entropy-cce\">Clipped Cross-Entropy (CCE)</h4>\n\n<p>Rejection of samples might not be optimal from the training’s point of view, because DNNs need vast amounts of data\nto be able to generalise properly. Therefore, <strong>Clipped Cross-Entropy</strong> doesn’t exclude the most contributing samples\nfrom the batch, but rather alleviates their impact by clipping the per-sample loss to a predefined value (<a href=\"#figure4\"><strong>Figure 4c</strong></a>).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"early-learning-regularisation-elr\">Early Learning Regularisation (ELR)</h4>\n\n<p>It has been recently observed that DNNs first fit clean samples, and then start memorising the noisy ones. This\nphenomenon reduces the generalisation properties of the model, distracting it from learning true patterns present\nin the data. <strong>Early Learning Regularisation</strong><sup id=\"fnref:4\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> mitigates memorisation with two tricks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Temporal ensembling</em> of targets: during the training step \\([k]\\), the original targets \\(\\pmb{\\text{t}}\\) are mixed\nwith the model’s predictions \\(\\pmb{\\text{p}}\\) from previous training steps. This prevents the gradient from diverging\nhugely between subsequent steps.

As such, we need a way to properly assign offers\nto correct category leaves. To this end, our Machine Learning Research team has developed a category classifier\nfor Allegro offers.</p>\n\n<p>The model in question is a large language model pre-trained on the Allegro catalogue (see more\nin <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T-R4kgIbBs&amp;list=PLzveSKBX_3N7yPb4ErB5HJ83eB6XvH37C&amp;index=20\"><i>Do you speak Allegro?</i></a>) and fine-tuned for offer classification.

Most of those products\nactually belong to some well-defined categories, but the merchant couldn’t find the right place for those offers\nat the time of their listing, because of the very rich taxonomy of the category tree.

In our experiments we implemented 7 of those methods\nand showed that they increase prediction accuracy in the presence of 20% synthetic noise when compared to the baseline\n(Cross-Entropy loss), most of them by a significant margin. The simple Clipped Cross-Entropy proved to be the best,\nwith an accuracy score of 89.51% (increase of 4.2 p.p. vs the baseline trained with noisy labels). This result is very\nclose to the baseline trained with clean labels (90.26%). Thus, we showed that for the case of 20% synthetic label\nnoise, it is possible to increase robustness so that the impact of label noise is negligible.</p>\n\n<p>These experiments are only a first step in making classifiers at Allegro robust to label noise. The case of synthetic\nnoise presented here is not very realistic: real-world label noise tends to be instance-dependent,\ni.e. it is influenced by individual sample features. As such, we plan to further evaluate the methods for increasing\nmodel robustness with a real-world dataset perturbed by instance-dependent noise.</p>\n\n<p>If you’d like to know more about label noise and model robustness, please refer to the papers listed below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10694\"><em>Deep Learning is Robust to Massive Label Noise</em>, Rolnick et al., 2018</a> <a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2010/hash/e57c6b956a6521b28495f2886ca0977a-Abstract.html\"><em>Self-Paced Learning for Latent Variable Models</em>, Kumar et al., 2010</a> <a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06735\"><em>Learning Deep Neural Networks under Agnostic Corrupted Supervision</em>, Liu et al., 2021</a> <a href=\"#fnref:3\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:4\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00151\"><em>Early-Learning Regularization Prevents Memorization of Noisy Labels</em>, Liu et al., 2020</a> <a href=\"#fnref:4\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:5\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02242\"><em>Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning</em>, Laine et al., 2017</a> <a href=\"#fnref:5\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:6\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04522\"><em>Generalized Jensen-Shannon Divergence Loss for Learning with Noisy Labels</em>, Englesson et al., 2021</a> <a href=\"#fnref:6\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a> <a href=\"#fnref:6:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;<sup>2</sup></a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:7\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06872\"><em>Co-teaching: Robust Training of Deep Neural Networks with Extremely Noisy Labels</em>, Han et al., 2018</a> <a href=\"#fnref:7\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a> <a href=\"#fnref:7:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;<sup>2</sup></a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:8\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412\"><em>mixup: Beyond Empirical Risk Minimization</em>, Zhang et al., 2018</a> <a href=\"#fnref:8\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n    <li id=\"fn:9\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749\"><em>Pervasive Label Errors in Test Sets Destabilize Machine Learning Benchmarks</em>, Northcutt et al., 2021</a> <a href=\"#fnref:9\" class=\"reversefootnote\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n","contentSnippet":"Label noise is ever-present in machine learning practice.\nAllegro datasets are no exception.\nWe compared 7 methods for training classifiers robust to label noise.\nAll of them improved the model’s performance on noisy datasets.\nSome of the methods decreased the model’s performance in the absence of label noise.\nWhat is label noise and why does it matter?\nIn the scope of supervised machine learning, specifically in classification tasks, the problem of label noise\nis of critical importance. It involves cases of incorrectly labelled training data. For example, let’s say that\nwe want to train a classification model to distinguish cats from dogs. For that purpose, we compose a training\ndataset with images labelled as either cat or dog. The labelling process is usually performed by human annotators,\nwho almost certainly produce some labelling errors. Unfortunately, human annotators can be confused by poor image\nquality, ambiguous image contents, or simply click the wrong item. As such, we inevitably end up with a dataset\nwhere some percentage of cats are labelled as dogs and vice versa (Figure 1).\n\n    \n    \n Figure 1. An example of label noise in a binary classification dataset. Some images in both categories were mislabelled by human annotators, which introduces noise to the training dataset. \nConsequently, the model trained with such data learns partially wrong associations, which then can lead to incorrect\npredictions for new images. The more label noise we have, the more we confuse the model during training. We can\nmeasure this by evaluating the classification error on a held-out test dataset (Figure 2). It is clear\nthat for high noise levels, it is very hard to recover the true training signal from the corrupted training data.\n\n    \n    \n Figure 2. Test accuracy as a function of label noise percentage.  The X axis indicates the ratio of mislabelled to correctly labelled examples. The dataset used here was ImageNet, corrupted with synthetic label noise. Image source: 1.\nHow can this problem be mitigated? One approach is to simply put more effort into the labelling process — we can let\nmultiple annotators label each data point and then evaluate the cross-annotator agreement. With enough time and effort,\nwe hope to obtain a dataset free of label noise. However, in practice this approach is rarely feasible due to large\nvolumes of training data and the need for efficient turnaround of machine learning projects. Consequently, we need\na different approach for handling corrupted training data, i.e. ML models robust to label noise.\nIn the context of this blog post, we define robustness as the model’s ability to efficiently learn in the presence\nof corrupted training data. In other words, a robust model can recover the correct training signal and ignore\nthe noise, so that it does not overfit to the corrupted traning set and can generalise during prediction. A major\nchallenge in this regard is the difficulty to estimate the proportion of label noise in real-world data. As such,\nrobust models are expected to handle varying amounts of label noise.\nHow to train a robust classifier?\nWe can improve the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) with a few tips and tricks presented in the recent\nliterature on Learning from Noisy Data. In general, there are three approaches to boosting the model’s resistance\nto noisy labels (Figure 3):\nRobust loss function boosting the training dynamics in the presence of noise.\nImplicit regularisation of the network aiming at decreasing the impact of noisy labels.\nFiltration of noisy data samples during the training or at the pre-training stage.\n\n    \n    \n Figure 3. Strategies for robustness.  In this blog post, we focused on two main approaches improving model robustness: utilisation of a robust loss function and implicit regularisation.\nIn the scope of this blog post, we present seven different methods that are strong baselines for improving\nthe generalisation of classifiers in the presence of label noise.\nRobust loss function\nSelf-Paced Learning (SPL)\nThe authors of Self-Paced Learning2 noticed that large per-sample loss might be an indication of label\ncorruption, especially in the latter stages of training. Clean labels should be easy to learn, while corrupted labels\nwould appear as difficult, resulting in a high per-sample loss.\nSPL proposes to exclude some predefined ratio of examples from the batch depending on their per-sample loss values\n(Figure 4a). Usually, the ratio is set as the estimated noise level in the dataset.\n\n    \n    \n  Figure 4. Comparison of loss filtration methods (SPL, PRL and CCE, see below).  While SPL and PRL exclude samples from loss calculation, CCE decreases the impact of potentially corrupted labels by clipping the per-sample loss values. Orange colour indicates candidate noisy samples. \nProvably Robust Learning (PRL)\nProvably Robust Learning3 derives from the ideas presented in the SPL paper, but the authors state that\ncorrupted labels should be detected depending on the gradient norm, instead of per-sample loss (Figure 4b).\nThe underlying intuition is that corrupted samples provoke the optimiser to make inadequately large steps\nin the optimisation space. The rest of the logic is the same as in SPL.\nClipped Cross-Entropy (CCE)\nRejection of samples might not be optimal from the training’s point of view, because DNNs need vast amounts of data\nto be able to generalise properly. Therefore, Clipped Cross-Entropy doesn’t exclude the most contributing samples\nfrom the batch, but rather alleviates their impact by clipping the per-sample loss to a predefined value (Figure 4c).\nEarly Learning Regularisation (ELR)\nIt has been recently observed that DNNs first fit clean samples, and then start memorising the noisy ones. This\nphenomenon reduces the generalisation properties of the model, distracting it from learning true patterns present\nin the data. Early Learning Regularisation4 mitigates memorisation with two tricks:\nTemporal ensembling of targets: during the training step \\([k]\\), the original targets \\(\\pmb{\\text{t}}\\) are mixed\nwith the model’s predictions \\(\\pmb{\\text{p}}\\) from previous training steps. This prevents the gradient from diverging\nhugely between subsequent steps. This trick is well-known in semi-supervised learning5:\nExplicit regularisation: an extra term is added to the default cross-entropy loss \\(\\mathcal{L}_{CE}(\\Theta)\\) that\nallows refinement of the early-learnt concepts, but penalises drastically contradicting predictions.\nThus, the gradient gets a boost for the clean samples, while the impact of noisy samples is neutralised\nby temporal ensembling.\nJensen-Shannon Divergence Loss (JSD)\nThe authors of Jensen-Shannon Divergence Loss 6 take yet another approach to loss construction,\nwhich is inspired by an empirical comparison between Cross-Entropy (CE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss. CE is known\nfor its fast convergence and brilliant training dynamics, while MAE provides spectacular robustness at the price\nof slow convergence.\nEnglesson et al. came up with the idea to use Jensen-Shannon Divergence, which is a proven generalisation of CE\nand MAE loss (Figure 5). JSD uses Kullback-Leibler Divergence \\(\\text{D}_{\\text{KL}}\\) between the target\nlabels \\(\\pmb{y}\\) and predictions of the model \\(f(\\pmb{x})\\) vs. their averaged distribution \\(\\pmb{m}\\). Summing up, one\ncan think of JSD as a CE with a robustness boost, or MAE with improved convergence.\n\n    \n    \n Figure 5. JSD as a generalisation of CE and MAE loss.  Depending on the parameter \\(\\pi_1\\), JSD resembles CE or MAE. Image source: 6.\nImplicit regularisation\nCo-teaching (CT)\nIn co-teaching 7, we simultaneously train two independent DNNs (Figure 6), and let them\nexchange examples during the training. The training feed (learning samples) provided by the peer network should\nideally consist only of clean samples. In CT, each network predicts which samples are clean and provides them to its\ncounterpart. Deciding whether a sample is clean relies on the trick known from SPL: the sample’s label is probably\nclean if its per-sample loss is low.\n\n    \n    \n Figure 6. Exchange of training feed in co-teaching.  Two peer networks exchange samples that are expected\nto be clean from noise. Image source: 7.\nCo-teaching is one of the most popular and universal baselines in the domain of learning from noisy data. It has\nwell-established empirical results, offers good performance even in extreme noise scenarios and can be simply\nintegrated into almost any architecture or downstream task. Unfortunately, it also has a few downsides. Firstly, there\nis no theoretical guarantee that such a training setup will eventually converge. Secondly, we may end up with\na consensus between the two networks, causing them to produce identical training feeds, and making the CT redundant.\nMixup\nMixup8 is a simple augmentation scheme that enforces linear behaviour of the model for in-between\ntraining samples (Figure 7). It linearly combines two training samples \\((\\pmb{x}_i, \\pmb{y}_i)\\)\nand \\((\\pmb{x}_j, \\pmb{y}_j)\\) with weight \\(\\lambda\\) sampled from the Beta distribution. It results in a new augmented sample with mixed input features \\(\\pmb{x}_{aug}\\) and a soft label \\(\\pmb{y}_{aug}\\):\n\n    \n    \n  Figure 7. Augmentation through mixup.  Two samples \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are linearly combined into a synthetic image \\(\\pmb{x}_{aug}\\) and a soft label \\(\\pmb{y}_{aug}\\). This new augmented input encourages the model to linearly interpolate the predictions between the original samples. \nThe method is a simple, universal, yet very effective approach. It yields good empirical results while adding\nno severe computational overhead.\nCleaning up Allegro\nEvery offer has its right place at Allegro, belonging to one out of over 23,000 categories. The category structure\nis a tree consisting of:\nthe root (Allegro),\nup to 7 levels of intermediate nodes (departments, metacategories, etc.) — over 2,600 nodes in total,\nover 23,000 leaves.\nOffers located in wrong categories are hard to find and hard to buy. As such, we need a way to properly assign offers\nto correct category leaves. To this end, our Machine Learning Research team has developed a category classifier\nfor Allegro offers.\nThe model in question is a large language model pre-trained on the Allegro catalogue (see more\nin Do you speak Allegro?) and fine-tuned for offer classification. Specifically, the downstream task here is extreme text classification: each offer is represented by text (title) and is classified into over 23,000 categories — hence the word extreme.\nClassification is particularly challenging for offers listed in ambiguous categories such as Other, Accessories, etc.\nThese categories are broad and hard to navigate, as they contain a wide variety of products. Most of those products\nactually belong to some well-defined categories, but the merchant couldn’t find the right place for those offers\nat the time of their listing, because of the very rich taxonomy of the category tree. Consequently, we decided\nto clean up the offers in ambiguous categories.\nHere’s the setup (Figure 8):\nWe train the category classifier on offers in well-defined categories: the model learns what lies where at Allegro.\nNext, we run inference on offers in ambiguous categories: the model moves the offers to their right destination.\nNote that this task is subject to domain shift: the assortment listed in these ambiguous categories may be harder\nto categorise than the regular assortment in other categories.\n\n    \n    \n  Figure 8. Category classifier: training & inference.  The model is trained on offers listed in well-defined categories. Then, it is used to move offers from ambiguous categories (Other, Accessories, etc.) to the well-defined categories. \nReal-world label noise at Allegro\nThe training set (offers in well-defined categories) is not 100% correct, for several reasons (Figure 9):\nthe merchant may have put the offer in the wrong category,\nthere are several similar categories in the catalogue,\nthere is no appropriate category for a given offer,\nthe taxonomy of the Allegro category tree changes over time.\n\n    \n    \n  Figure 9. Examples of mislabelled offers.  With over 23,000 categories at Allegro, listing each offer in its best-matching category can be challenging for merchants. Hence, label noise is an inherent feature of our training dataset. \nThe ML model is prone to memorisation of the wrong labels in the training set, i.e. overfitting. These errors will\nlikely be reproduced at prediction time. Our goal is to train a robust classifier that will learn the true patterns\nand ignore the mislabelled training instances.\nThe training methods described in the previous section were developed and evaluated on computer vision tasks,\ne.g. image classification, into a relatively small number of categories. Here, we face the problem of extreme text\nclassification. Thus, we need to adapt those methods for textual input and find out which concepts transfer well between\nthe two domains.\nSynthetic label noise\nTo evaluate the model’s robustness experimentally, we need to know a priori which training instances were\nmislabelled. For that, we use a generator of controllable noise. The experimental setup consists of five steps\n(Figure 10):\ndumping a clean dataset from a curated pool of offers that are certainly in the right place,\nsplitting it into training, validation and test sets,\napplication of synthetic noise to 20% of instances in the training and validation sets (changing the offer’s category\nto a wrong one),\ntraining the model on the noisy dataset,\ntesting the model on a held-out fraction of the clean dataset.\n\n    \n    \n  Figure 10. Testing the model’s robustness.  The full dataset of clean instances (offers with true category labels) is split into training, validation and test sets. Next, label noise is introduced to the training and validation sets and the model is trained. The model is tested on a held-out fraction of the clean dataset. \nThis setup lets us answer the following question:\nHow much does the noise in the training set hurt the model’s performance on the clean test set?\nThis way, we can evaluate different methods of training classifiers under label noise and choose the most robust\nclassifier, according to accuracy on the test set.\nAnd… it works!\nBelow we present the results of experiments for 1.3M offers listed in the Construction Work & Equipment category.\nSymmetric noise was applied to 20% of the training set. This means that the category labels of that percentage\nof offers were changed to different randomly chosen labels. We evaluated the 7 training methods outlined above\nand compared them to the baseline: classification with cross-entropy loss.\nBaseline: Memorising doesn’t pay off\nHow does the presence of noise impact the baseline model?\nThe validation curves for non-corrupted samples clearly show the severe impact of noisy labels on the model’s\nperformance (Figure 11). In the early stage of training, the performance of the model trained\non noisy data is on par with the metrics of the model trained on clean data. Yet, starting from the 4th epoch,\nthe wrong labels in the noisy dataset appear to prevent the model from discovering the true patterns in the training\ndata, resulting in a 5 p.p. drop in accuracy at the end of the training. We attribute this drop to the memorisation\nof the wrong labels: instead of refining the originally learnt concepts, the network starts to overfit to the noisy\nlabels. The labels memorised for particular offers don’t help with classifying previously unseen offers at test time.\n\n    \n    \n Figure 11. Degradation of the baseline model in the presence of noise. The 20% synthetic noise degrades the model throughout the training. In the end, the model trained on the corrupted dataset exhibits 5 p.p. lower accuracy in comparison to its clean counterpart \nTowards robust classification\nDoes robustness imply underfitting?\nTo verify if the evaluated methods have any effect on the model’s performance when there is no noise in the training\ndata, we tested all of them on a clean dataset without any synthetic noise.\nIn the absence of corrupted data, three of the tested methods (SPL, PRL and CT) are effectively reduced to the baseline\nCross-Entropy. Therefore, the accuracy for those methods was exactly the same as for the baseline (Table 1).\nFor mixup, the difference from the baseline was within the standard deviation range, so it was marked as no improvement\nas well.\nFor CCE and JSD the performance degraded, but only slightly — by 0.04 p.p. for the former and 0.34 p.p. for the latter.\nThis drop is an acceptable compromise considering the robustness to noise that these methods enable (see below).\nELR was the only method that improved upon the baseline, by 0.07 p.p. As ELR relies on temporal ensembling, which\ndiminishes the impact of corrupted samples during training, we hypothesise that our clean dataset contained a small\nnumber of mislabelled examples. Such paradoxes are a frequent case in machine learning practice, even for renowned\nbenchmark datasets like CIFAR-1009.\nTable 1.

Mixup treats all samples equally, even if their labels\nare corrupted. The marginal improvement upon the baseline is evident in the validation accuracy training curve\n(Figure 12). Mixup starts to overfit around the 5th epoch, similarly to the baseline, and unlike all\nthe other methods.\n\n    \n    \n Figure 12. Validation accuracy during training. Validation accuracy for all methods was measured during training. It is evident that the best methods are CCE, ELR and JSD, with CT, PRL and SPL trailing slightly behind. Mixup behaves similarly to the baseline. \nConclusions\nThe problem of label noise is unavoidable in machine learning practice, and Allegro datasets are no exception.\nFortunately, there exist numerous methods that diminish the impact of label noise on prediction performance\nby increasing the robustness of machine learning models. In our experiments we implemented 7 of those methods\nand showed that they increase prediction accuracy in the presence of 20% synthetic noise when compared to the baseline\n(Cross-Entropy loss), most of them by a significant margin. The simple Clipped Cross-Entropy proved to be the best,\nwith an accuracy score of 89.51% (increase of 4.2 p.p. vs the baseline trained with noisy labels). This result is very\nclose to the baseline trained with clean labels (90.26%). Thus, we showed that for the case of 20% synthetic label\nnoise, it is possible to increase robustness so that the impact of label noise is negligible.\nThese experiments are only a first step in making classifiers at Allegro robust to label noise. The case of synthetic\nnoise presented here is not very realistic: real-world label noise tends to be instance-dependent,\ni.e. it is influenced by individual sample features. As such, we plan to further evaluate the methods for increasing\nmodel robustness with a real-world dataset perturbed by instance-dependent noise.\nIf you’d like to know more about label noise and model robustness, please refer to the papers listed below.\nDeep Learning is Robust to Massive Label Noise, Rolnick et al., 2018 ↩\nSelf-Paced Learning for Latent Variable Models, Kumar et al., 2010 ↩\nLearning Deep Neural Networks under Agnostic Corrupted Supervision, Liu et al., 2021 ↩\nEarly-Learning Regularization Prevents Memorization of Noisy Labels, Liu et al., 2020 ↩\nTemporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning, Laine et al., 2017 ↩\nGeneralized Jensen-Shannon Divergence Loss for Learning with Noisy Labels, Englesson et al., 2021 ↩ ↩2\nCo-teaching: Robust Training of Deep Neural Networks with Extremely Noisy Labels, Han et al., 2018 ↩ ↩2\nmixup: Beyond Empirical Risk Minimization, Zhang et al., 2018 ↩\nPervasive Label Errors in Test Sets Destabilize Machine Learning Benchmarks, Northcutt et al., 2021 ↩","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/04/learning-from-noisy-data.html","categories":["tech","mlr","robustness","research","ml","machine-learning","ai"],"isoDate":"2023-04-17T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"},{"title":"Dynamic Workload Balancing in Hermes","link":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/04/dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes.html","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0200","authors":{"author":[{"name":["Piotr Rżysko"],"photo":["https://blog.allegro.tech/img/authors/piotr.rzysko.jpg"],"url":["https://blog.allegro.tech/authors/piotr.rzysko"]}]},"content":"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/allegro/hermes\">Hermes</a> is a distributed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern\">publish-subscribe</a>\nmessage broker that we use at <a href=\"https://allegro.tech\">Allegro</a> to facilitate asynchronous communication between our\nmicroservices.

In this blog post, we will present the implementation of a dynamic\nworkload balancing algorithm that we developed to address this challenge. We will describe the approach we took, the\nlessons we learned along the way, and the results we achieved.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"hermes-architecture\">Hermes Architecture</h2>\n\n<p>Before we delve deeper into the article’s topic, let’s first briefly introduce the architecture of Hermes, depicted in\nthe diagram below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/hermes_architecture.png\" alt=\"Hermes Architecture\" /></p>\n\n<p>As we can see, Hermes is composed of two main modules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Hermes Frontend</strong> acts as a gateway, receiving messages from publishers via its REST interface, applying necessary\n  preprocessing, and eventually storing them in <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\">Apache Kafka</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Hermes Consumers</strong> is a component that constitutes the delivery part of the system. Its role is to fetch messages\n  from Kafka and push them to predefined subscribers while providing reliability mechanisms such as retries, backpressure,\n  and rate limiting. For the sake of brevity, in the latter parts of the article, we’ll refer to a single instance of this\n  module as a <em>consumer</em>.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since the rest of this post discusses topics that mainly pertain to the delivery side of the system, let’s turn our\nattention to that now.</p>\n\n<p>Apache Kafka organizes messages, also known as events, into topics. To facilitate parallelism, a topic usually has\nmultiple partitions. Each event is stored in only one partition. When someone wants to receive messages from a given\ntopic via Hermes, they create a new subscription with the defined HTTP endpoint to which messages will be delivered. Under the\nhood, Hermes assigns a group of <em>consumers</em> to that subscription, with each <em>consumer</em> handling at least one of the\ntopic partitions. By default, a fixed number of <em>consumers</em> are assigned to a subscription, but the administrator can\nmanually override this number on a per-subscription basis. It’s also worth noting that a single <em>consumer</em> can handle\nmultiple subscriptions. The following diagram illustrates this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/partitions.png\" alt=\"Hermes Consumers\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"workload-balancer\">Workload Balancer</h2>\n\n<p>The Hermes Consumers module is designed to operate in highly dynamic environments, e.g. in the cloud, where new\ninstances can be added, restarted, or removed at almost any time. This means that the module can handle these situations\nseamlessly and without disrupting the flow of messages. Additionally, it is horizontally scalable, meaning that\nwhen there is an increase in the number of subscriptions or an increase in outgoing traffic, we can easily scale out\nthe cluster by adding new <em>consumers</em>. This adaptability to changing circumstances is achieved by a mechanism called the\n“workload balancer.” It acts as an arbiter, monitoring the state of the cluster, and if necessary, proposing\nappropriate adjustments in the distribution of subscriptions to the rest of the nodes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"motivations-for-improving-workload-balancer\">Motivations for Improving Workload Balancer</h2>\n\n<p>Our first implementation of the workload balancer aimed to always assign the same number of subscriptions to each\n<em>consumer</em>. This strategy is easy to understand and performs optimally when subscriptions are equal with respect to\ntheir load. However, this is not always the case. For example, imagine that we have two subscriptions. The first\nprocesses 1,000 messages per second, and the second only 10 messages per second. It is highly likely that they will\nnot consume the same number of CPU cores, network bandwidth, etc. Thus, if we want to spread the load evenly,\nwe should not assume that they are equal.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, when we deploy our application in the cloud, we have to predefine the number of instances and the amount of\nresources (e.g. CPU, memory, etc.) that should be allocated to it. Unless we use a mechanism that adjusts these\nvalues on a per-instance basis, each instance will receive an equal share of the available resources. Now, let’s take\na look at the CPU usage of each <em>consumer</em> from one of our Hermes production clusters using the workload balancer\nwhich does not account for the disproportions between subscriptions:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_before.png\"><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_before.png\" alt=\"Initial CPU usage\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>The figure below shows the difference in CPU usage between the least and most heavily loaded <em>consumers</em>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_before_least_and_most.png\"><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_before_least_and_most.png\" alt=\"CPU usage of the least and most heavily loaded consumers\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Taking into account all of the above factors, in order not to compromise system performance, we always had to determine\nthe right allocation based on the most loaded instance. Consequently, less busy instances were wasting resources as\ntheir demands were lower, not making the most of what was available. Knowing that our Hermes production clusters will\ncontinue to grow in terms of both traffic and the number of topics and subscriptions, we decided to develop a new and\nimproved workload balancer, which we will discuss in the next section. We knew that if we didn’t do this, we would have\nto over-allocate even more resources in the future.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"solution\">Solution</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"constraints-and-requirements\">Constraints and Requirements</h3>\n\n<p>Before we proceed to the description of the solution we devised, we would like to discuss the requirements and\nconstraints that guided our design process.</p>\n\n<p>First, we wanted to preserve the core responsibilities of the original workload balancer, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Allocating work across newly added <em>consumers</em></li>\n  <li>Distributing work from removed <em>consumers</em></li>\n  <li>Assigning newly added subscriptions to available <em>consumers</em></li>\n  <li>Reclaiming resources previously assigned to removed subscriptions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Secondly, we decided not to change the existing rule of assigning the same number of subscriptions to each <em>consumer</em>.\nThe reasoning behind this decision stemmed from the threading model implemented in Hermes Consumers, where every\nsubscription assigned to a <em>consumer</em> is handled by a separate thread. Having an unequal number of threads between\n<em>consumers</em> could potentially lead to some consumers being overwhelmed with more\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch\">context switches</a> and a higher memory footprint.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we wanted to preserve the strategy of determining the number of <em>consumers</em> a subscription should be\nassigned to (fixed and globally configured, but with the option of being overridden on a per-subscription basis by the\nadministrator). Although it may not be optimal, for the reasons mentioned earlier, we chose to narrow down the scope of the\nimprovements, keep it as is, and potentially revisit it in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The last and very important factor that we had to consider while designing the new algorithm was the cost tied to\nevery change in the assignment of subscriptions, particularly the cost of rebalancing Kafka’s consumer groups\n(i.e. temporarily suspending the delivery of messages from partitions affected by the rebalance until the process is\ncompleted).</p>\n\n<p>With all of the above preconditions met, we were able to augment the capabilities of the workload balancer by making it\naware of the heterogeneity of the subscriptions. We will discuss how we approached this in the following two subsections.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"first-attempt\">First Attempt</h3>\n\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, the main reason for the imbalance was the fact that the original balancing algorithm was\nunaware of the differences between subscriptions. Therefore, in the first place, we wanted to make subscriptions\ncomparable by associating with each of them an attribute called “weight.” Internally, it’s a vector of metrics\ncharacterizing a subscription. Currently, this vector has only one element, named “operations per second.” A single\noperation is an action executed by a <em>consumer</em> in the context of a given subscription, such as fetching an event from\nKafka, committing offsets to Kafka, or sending an event to a subscriber. In the future, we may extend the\nweight vector by adding metrics that will allow us to eliminate uneven consumption of resources other than CPU.</p>\n\n<p>Based on weights reported by individual <em>consumers</em>, a leader (one of the nodes from the Hermes Consumers cluster)\nbuilds subscription profiles, which are records containing information about subscriptions necessary for making\nbalancing decisions. Among the details included in each profile are the weight and the timestamp of the last rebalance.\nIt’s important to remember that a single subscription can be spanned across multiple <em>consumers</em>, resulting in multiple\nweight vectors associated with a single subscription. To resolve this, the leader builds a final weight vector (\\(W\\)),\nwhich is used in further calculations:</p>\n\n<p>\\begin{equation}\nW =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nmax(m_{11},m_{12},\\cdots,m_{1M}) &amp; max(m_{21},m_{22},\\cdots,m_{2M}) &amp; \\cdots &amp; max(m_{N1},m_{N2},\\cdots,m_{NM})\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation}</p>\n\n<p>where:</p>\n\n<p>\\(m_{ij}\\) is the value of metric \\(i\\) reported by <em>consumer</em> \\(j\\)</p>\n\n<p>\\(N\\) is the number of metrics included in the weight vector</p>\n\n<p>\\(M\\) is the number of <em>consumers</em></p>\n\n<p>It’s also worth noting that in order to smooth out abrupt changes and short-term fluctuations in traffic, we apply an\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing\">exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA)</a> to the collected\nmetrics.</p>\n\n<p>To address the requirement regarding the cost of reassigning subscriptions, we introduced a global parameter called\n“stabilization window.” After a subscription is assigned, the stabilization window determines the minimum time before\nthe subscription can be reassigned. This “freezes” the subscription so that it doesn’t get reassigned too quickly,\nallowing the subscription to catch up with the events produced during the rebalancing process.</p>\n\n<p>Equipped with the necessary terminology, we can now proceed to describe the algorithm itself. The high-level idea is\nfairly simple and boils down to the leader periodically executing the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Fetch subscription weights from every <em>consumer</em>.</li>\n  <li>Using information from the previous step, rebuild subscription profiles.</li>\n  <li>Calculate the total weight of the whole Hermes Consumers cluster by summing all subscription weights.</li>\n  <li>Determine the target consumer weight as an average of the weights of all <em>consumers</em> in the cluster.</li>\n  <li>Build a set of <em>consumers</em> whose weights are above the average calculated in step 4.</li>\n  <li>Build a set of <em>consumers</em> whose weights are below the average calculated in step 4.</li>\n  <li>Swap subscriptions between the sets calculated in the previous two steps while maintaining the following restrictions:\n    <ul>\n      <li>The weight of an instance from the overloaded set (step 5) is smaller than it was before the swap but is not\nsmaller than the target value.</li>\n      <li>The weight of an instance from the underloaded set (step 6) is greater than it was before the swap but is not\ngreater than the target value.</li>\n      <li>If, for a given subscription, the period of time since the last rebalance is shorter than the stabilization\nwindow, don’t consider the subscription eligible for the swap.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The graph below shows the results we obtained after deploying the implementation of this algorithm to production:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_first_attempt.png\"><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_first_attempt.png\" alt=\"CPU usage after the first attempt\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Although the graph shows that the new algorithm got us closer to having uniform utilization of CPU, we were not fully\nsatisfied with that outcome. The reason for that is depicted below, where we compare the most loaded instance with the\nleast loaded one. The degree of disparity in terms of CPU usage is still significant. Therefore, we decided to at least\ndetermine the reason for that state of affairs and, if possible, refine the algorithm.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_first_attempt_least_most.png\"><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_first_attempt_least_most.png\" alt=\"CPU usage of the least and most heavily loaded consumers after the first attempt\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>While investigating this issue, we noticed a correlation between the class of hardware that <em>consumers</em> run on and\ntheir CPU usage. This observation led us to the conclusion that, despite the fact that load is evenly distributed,\ninstances running on older generations of hardware utilize a higher percentage of available CPU power than those running\non newer hardware, which is understandable as older machines are typically less performant. In the following section, we\ndescribe how we tackled this issue.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"second-attempt\">Second Attempt</h3>\n\n<p>After our investigation, it was clear to us that if we wanted to achieve uniform CPU usage across the entire Hermes cluster,\naiming for processing the same number of operations per second on each instance was not the way to go. This led us to the\nquestion of how to determine the ideal number of operations per second that each instance can handle without being either\noverloaded or underloaded. To answer this, we had to take into account the fact that in the cloud environment, it is not\nalways possible to precisely define the hardware that our application will be running on. Potentially, we could put the\nburden of making the right decision on the Hermes administrator. However, this is a very tedious task and also hard to\nmaintain in dynamic environments where applications are almost constantly moved around different physical machines.</p>\n\n<p>As we wanted to avoid any manual tuning, we decided to employ a concept well-known in\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_control_theory\">Control Theory</a>, called a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_control\">proportional controller</a>. To explain the idea behind this concept,\nlet’s use an example. In the following picture, we see an operator who must adjust a hand valve to achieve the desired\ntemperature in a furnace. The operator doesn’t know upfront what the appropriate degree to which the valve should be\nopen is, therefore it is necessary to use a trial-and-error method to attain the desired outcome.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/proportional_controler.png\" alt=\"Proportional Controller\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now let’s take a look at how this example relates to Control Theory. Using Control Theory terms, we can say that the\npicture presents a feedback control system, also known as a closed-loop control system. In such systems, the current\nstate and desired state of the system are referred to as the process variable and set point, respectively. In the example,\nthe current temperature in the furnace represents the process variable, while the temperature that the operator wants to\nachieve is the set point. To fully automate the control system and eliminate the need for manual adjustments, we typically\nreplace the operator with two components: an actuator and a controller. The controller calculates an error, which is the\ndifference between the set point and the process variable. Based on the error, the controller proportionally increases\nor decreases its output (in this example, the degree to which the valve is open). The actuator uses the controller’s\noutput to physically adjust the state of the system.</p>\n\n<p>If we think about it, we realize that the problem a proportional controller solves is very similar to the one we\nencounter when we run Hermes on heterogeneous hardware. Specifically, our goal is to achieve equal CPU usage across all\n<em>consumers</em>, with the average usage of all <em>consumers</em> being our target. Additionally, we know that the number of\noperations per second processed by each <em>consumer</em> directly affects CPU usage. By utilizing a proportional\ncontroller, we can determine the value of this variable by calculating the error (the difference between the\ntarget and current CPU usage) and then adjusting the target weight accordingly. If we run the controller\nin a continuous loop, where it increases the target weight when current usage is below the target and vice versa, we\nshould eventually reach the set point.</p>\n\n<p>After integrating a proportional controller into our algorithm and deploying it to production, we were able to achieve\nthe following results:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_second_attempt.png\"><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-04-05-dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes/cpu_second_attempt.png\" alt=\"CPU usage after the second attempt\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>As we can see, the current CPU usage of all instances is very similar. This is exactly what we aimed for. If we\nassume that we are targeting 40% CPU utilization (to be able to handle additional traffic in case of a datacenter failover),\nby introducing the new algorithm we reduced the amount of allocated resources by approximately 42%.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-and-potential-improvements\">Conclusion and Potential Improvements</h2>\n\n<p>In this post, we have described the challenges we faced with balancing load in our Hermes clusters, and the steps we\ntook to overcome them. By introducing our new workload balancing algorithm that dynamically adapts to varying\nsubscription loads and heterogeneous hardware, we were able to achieve a more uniform distribution of CPU usage across\nHermes Consumers instances.</p>\n\n<p>This approach has allowed us to significantly reduce the amount of allocated resources and avoid performance issues\ncaused by the imbalance that we observed earlier. However, there is still room for improvement. So far, we have been\nfocused on optimizing CPU utilization, but the way the algorithm is designed, enables us to extend the spectrum of\nbalanced resources in the future. For instance, we may consider factoring in memory and network bandwidth as well.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we plan to improve the ease of operating Hermes clusters. We aim to avoid having tuning knobs and putting\nthe burden of setting them correctly on the user. One such knob that we may want to remove in the future is the parameter\ndefining how many consumers are assigned to a subscription. Currently, the Hermes administrator is responsible for\nchoosing the value of this parameter for subscriptions where the default value is not a good fit. We suspect that this\ntask could be automated by delegating it to the workload balancer.</p>\n","contentSnippet":"Hermes is a distributed publish-subscribe\nmessage broker that we use at Allegro to facilitate asynchronous communication between our\nmicroservices.

Although it may not be optimal, for the reasons mentioned earlier, we chose to narrow down the scope of the\nimprovements, keep it as is, and potentially revisit it in the future.\nThe last and very important factor that we had to consider while designing the new algorithm was the cost tied to\nevery change in the assignment of subscriptions, particularly the cost of rebalancing Kafka’s consumer groups\n(i.e. temporarily suspending the delivery of messages from partitions affected by the rebalance until the process is\ncompleted).\nWith all of the above preconditions met, we were able to augment the capabilities of the workload balancer by making it\naware of the heterogeneity of the subscriptions. We will discuss how we approached this in the following two subsections.\nFirst Attempt\nAs we mentioned earlier, the main reason for the imbalance was the fact that the original balancing algorithm was\nunaware of the differences between subscriptions. Therefore, in the first place, we wanted to make subscriptions\ncomparable by associating with each of them an attribute called “weight.” Internally, it’s a vector of metrics\ncharacterizing a subscription. Currently, this vector has only one element, named “operations per second.” A single\noperation is an action executed by a consumer in the context of a given subscription, such as fetching an event from\nKafka, committing offsets to Kafka, or sending an event to a subscriber. In the future, we may extend the\nweight vector by adding metrics that will allow us to eliminate uneven consumption of resources other than CPU.\nBased on weights reported by individual consumers, a leader (one of the nodes from the Hermes Consumers cluster)\nbuilds subscription profiles, which are records containing information about subscriptions necessary for making\nbalancing decisions. Among the details included in each profile are the weight and the timestamp of the last rebalance.\nIt’s important to remember that a single subscription can be spanned across multiple consumers, resulting in multiple\nweight vectors associated with a single subscription. To resolve this, the leader builds a final weight vector (\\(W\\)),\nwhich is used in further calculations:\n\\begin{equation}\nW =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nmax(m_{11},m_{12},\\cdots,m_{1M}) & max(m_{21},m_{22},\\cdots,m_{2M}) & \\cdots & max(m_{N1},m_{N2},\\cdots,m_{NM})\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere:\n\\(m_{ij}\\) is the value of metric \\(i\\) reported by consumer \\(j\\)\n\\(N\\) is the number of metrics included in the weight vector\n\\(M\\) is the number of consumers\nIt’s also worth noting that in order to smooth out abrupt changes and short-term fluctuations in traffic, we apply an\nexponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) to the collected\nmetrics.\nTo address the requirement regarding the cost of reassigning subscriptions, we introduced a global parameter called\n“stabilization window.” After a subscription is assigned, the stabilization window determines the minimum time before\nthe subscription can be reassigned. This “freezes” the subscription so that it doesn’t get reassigned too quickly,\nallowing the subscription to catch up with the events produced during the rebalancing process.\nEquipped with the necessary terminology, we can now proceed to describe the algorithm itself. The high-level idea is\nfairly simple and boils down to the leader periodically executing the following steps:\nFetch subscription weights from every consumer.\nUsing information from the previous step, rebuild subscription profiles.\nCalculate the total weight of the whole Hermes Consumers cluster by summing all subscription weights.\nDetermine the target consumer weight as an average of the weights of all consumers in the cluster.\nBuild a set of consumers whose weights are above the average calculated in step 4.\nBuild a set of consumers whose weights are below the average calculated in step 4.\nSwap subscriptions between the sets calculated in the previous two steps while maintaining the following restrictions:\n    \nThe weight of an instance from the overloaded set (step 5) is smaller than it was before the swap but is not\nsmaller than the target value.\nThe weight of an instance from the underloaded set (step 6) is greater than it was before the swap but is not\ngreater than the target value.\nIf, for a given subscription, the period of time since the last rebalance is shorter than the stabilization\nwindow, don’t consider the subscription eligible for the swap.\nThe graph below shows the results we obtained after deploying the implementation of this algorithm to production:\n\nAlthough the graph shows that the new algorithm got us closer to having uniform utilization of CPU, we were not fully\nsatisfied with that outcome. The reason for that is depicted below, where we compare the most loaded instance with the\nleast loaded one. The degree of disparity in terms of CPU usage is still significant. Therefore, we decided to at least\ndetermine the reason for that state of affairs and, if possible, refine the algorithm.\n\nWhile investigating this issue, we noticed a correlation between the class of hardware that consumers run on and\ntheir CPU usage. This observation led us to the conclusion that, despite the fact that load is evenly distributed,\ninstances running on older generations of hardware utilize a higher percentage of available CPU power than those running\non newer hardware, which is understandable as older machines are typically less performant. In the following section, we\ndescribe how we tackled this issue.\nSecond Attempt\nAfter our investigation, it was clear to us that if we wanted to achieve uniform CPU usage across the entire Hermes cluster,\naiming for processing the same number of operations per second on each instance was not the way to go. This led us to the\nquestion of how to determine the ideal number of operations per second that each instance can handle without being either\noverloaded or underloaded. To answer this, we had to take into account the fact that in the cloud environment, it is not\nalways possible to precisely define the hardware that our application will be running on. Potentially, we could put the\nburden of making the right decision on the Hermes administrator. However, this is a very tedious task and also hard to\nmaintain in dynamic environments where applications are almost constantly moved around different physical machines.\nAs we wanted to avoid any manual tuning, we decided to employ a concept well-known in\nControl Theory, called a\nproportional controller. To explain the idea behind this concept,\nlet’s use an example. In the following picture, we see an operator who must adjust a hand valve to achieve the desired\ntemperature in a furnace. The operator doesn’t know upfront what the appropriate degree to which the valve should be\nopen is, therefore it is necessary to use a trial-and-error method to attain the desired outcome.\n\nNow let’s take a look at how this example relates to Control Theory. Using Control Theory terms, we can say that the\npicture presents a feedback control system, also known as a closed-loop control system. In such systems, the current\nstate and desired state of the system are referred to as the process variable and set point, respectively. In the example,\nthe current temperature in the furnace represents the process variable, while the temperature that the operator wants to\nachieve is the set point. To fully automate the control system and eliminate the need for manual adjustments, we typically\nreplace the operator with two components: an actuator and a controller. The controller calculates an error, which is the\ndifference between the set point and the process variable. Based on the error, the controller proportionally increases\nor decreases its output (in this example, the degree to which the valve is open). The actuator uses the controller’s\noutput to physically adjust the state of the system.\nIf we think about it, we realize that the problem a proportional controller solves is very similar to the one we\nencounter when we run Hermes on heterogeneous hardware. Specifically, our goal is to achieve equal CPU usage across all\nconsumers, with the average usage of all consumers being our target. Additionally, we know that the number of\noperations per second processed by each consumer directly affects CPU usage. By utilizing a proportional\ncontroller, we can determine the value of this variable by calculating the error (the difference between the\ntarget and current CPU usage) and then adjusting the target weight accordingly. If we run the controller\nin a continuous loop, where it increases the target weight when current usage is below the target and vice versa, we\nshould eventually reach the set point.\nAfter integrating a proportional controller into our algorithm and deploying it to production, we were able to achieve\nthe following results:\n\nAs we can see, the current CPU usage of all instances is very similar. This is exactly what we aimed for. If we\nassume that we are targeting 40% CPU utilization (to be able to handle additional traffic in case of a datacenter failover),\nby introducing the new algorithm we reduced the amount of allocated resources by approximately 42%.\nConclusion and Potential Improvements\nIn this post, we have described the challenges we faced with balancing load in our Hermes clusters, and the steps we\ntook to overcome them. By introducing our new workload balancing algorithm that dynamically adapts to varying\nsubscription loads and heterogeneous hardware, we were able to achieve a more uniform distribution of CPU usage across\nHermes Consumers instances.\nThis approach has allowed us to significantly reduce the amount of allocated resources and avoid performance issues\ncaused by the imbalance that we observed earlier. However, there is still room for improvement. So far, we have been\nfocused on optimizing CPU utilization, but the way the algorithm is designed, enables us to extend the spectrum of\nbalanced resources in the future. For instance, we may consider factoring in memory and network bandwidth as well.\nAdditionally, we plan to improve the ease of operating Hermes clusters. We aim to avoid having tuning knobs and putting\nthe burden of setting them correctly on the user. One such knob that we may want to remove in the future is the parameter\ndefining how many consumers are assigned to a subscription. Currently, the Hermes administrator is responsible for\nchoosing the value of this parameter for subscriptions where the default value is not a good fit. We suspect that this\ntask could be automated by delegating it to the workload balancer.","guid":"https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/04/dynamic-workload-balancing-in-hermes.html","categories":["tech","architecture","hermes","kafka","algorithms","pub/sub","publish-subscribe","load balancing","open source"],"isoDate":"2023-04-04T22:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"images/post-headers/default.jpg"}],"jobs":[{"id":"743999917710193","name":"Senior Mobile Software Engineer (iOS) - Technology Consumer Experience","uuid":"c76d03f3-6013-4c45-a5e3-44825220da80","jobAdId":"13f5aa4b-627a-408b-a290-7f8ff37b4401","defaultJobAd":false,"refNumber":"REF3121F","company":{"identifier":"Allegro","name":"Allegro"},"releasedDate":"2023-07-10T08:30:15.541Z","location":{"city":"Poznań, Warszawa","region":"","country":"pl","address":"","postalCode":"","remote":false},"industry":{"id":"internet","label":"Internet"},"department":{"id":"2572770","label":"IT - Software Development"},"function":{"id":"information_technology","label":"Information Technology"},"typeOfEmployment":{"id":"permanent","label":"Full-time"},"experienceLevel":{"id":"mid_senior_level","label":"Mid-Senior Level"},"customField":[{"fieldId":"58c15608e4b01d4b19ddf790","fieldLabel":"Recruitment Process","valueId":"ed4682c7-33c9-41c2-8d13-428ed39046f5","valueLabel":"Tech.
