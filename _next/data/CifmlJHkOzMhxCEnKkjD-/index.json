In response, a\ncolleague lamented that what we would miss most is the knowledge departing with the leader. Unfortunately, that’s how it goes. Not only do we lose a colleague,\nbut we also lose valuable knowledge and experience. However, this isn’t a story about my supervisor; it’s a story about all those individuals who are experts in\ntheir fields, who understand the paths to success and paths that lead to catastrophic failures. When they leave, they take with them knowledge that you won’t\nfind in any book, note, or Jira ticket. And this leads to a fundamental question: <em>What can be done to avoid this “black hole” of knowledge? How can we ensure\nit doesn’t vanish along with them?</em> That’s what this article is all about.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"business-decisions-somebody-made-and-didnt-tell-you\">Business Decisions Somebody Made… and didn’t tell you</h2>\n\n<p>Specifically for this article I created the term <em>Biological Data Storage</em> or <em>BDS</em> for short. This term encompasses nearly every employee in a company. I\nunderstand that nobody wants to be seen as just a resource, and certainly not as part of the <em>Biological Data Storage</em>. However, in the context of a company’s\nresources, an employee can be likened to a technical data repository, but with the valuable addition of context.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to examine this issue more broadly from an engineer’s perspective. We often hear about Conway’s Law:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure. <sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And I perceive the loss of knowledge as a depletion of communication, which can ultimately result in its imperfections within the created system.</p>\n\n<p>The engineering approach is marked by our commitment to gauging the impact of various events and assessing their real significance using specific metrics. When\ndealing with the challenge of an employee departing, consider these metrics to evaluate organizational effectiveness:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Time to Problem Resolution:\n    <ul>\n      <li>measures how quickly issues or challenges are resolved and helps identify the efficiency of problem-solving processes.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Knowledge Transfer Rate:\n    <ul>\n      <li>measures how long it takes for a new employee to become self-sufficient and also indicates the effectiveness of knowledge transfer and onboarding.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think these metrics provide valuable insights into organizational efficiency and its capacity to seamlessly integrate new team members.\nIn the context of Conway’s Law, the loss of knowledge becomes a critical factor influencing not only communication but also the very design of systems within\nthe company.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this: when a team member with a wealth of knowledge and expertise departs, they take with them not just facts and figures but also their unique\ninsights, problem-solving approaches, and understanding of the organization’s intricacies. The lack of such knowledge can disrupt the flow of information within\nteams and across departments. As a result, the communication structure can falter, hindering the organization’s ability to respond to challenges effectively.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the design of systems can be profoundly impacted. Engineers and developers who were privy to invaluable knowledge may have made design choices based\non their expertise. These decisions may not have been documented or clearly understood by others, and when their authors leave, may become opaque. This can lead\nto difficulties in maintaining and developing these systems, potentially causing inefficiencies and vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when we introduce the <em>Knowledge Transfer Rate</em> metric into this context, it becomes evident that measuring how long it takes for a new employee to become\nself-sufficient is crucial. The longer this duration, the more pronounced the knowledge gap becomes, affecting both communication and system design.\nOrganizations must recognize that knowledge isn’t just about data; it’s about understanding and context, and its loss can significantly impede the smooth\nfunctioning of teams and the evolution of systems.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"organizations-have-no-memory\">Organizations have no memory</h2>\n\n<p>You might ask, “What’s the impact of losing this knowledge on a company?” Is it that business processes start collapsing like houses of cards? Innovation loses\nits wings? The company’s efficiency plummets like leaves in an autumn storm?\nThe answer to the above questions in 98% of cases is - of course, no - because we can manage such risks. Companies have ways of dealing with them, but do they,\nreally?</p>\n\n<p><em>Organizations have no memory</em> is a quote from Trevor Kletz’s book <em>Lessons from Disaster</em>, which highlights the concept of organizational memory and how\nincidents and accidents can recur due to the lack of effective learning from past mistakes within an organization. Prof. Kletz highlights the organization’s\ninability to learn from accidents, even those occurring within the company. I sometimes feel that a similar pattern emerges when knowledge departs from our\ncompany. Perhaps because it can’t be easily measured in money, it’s often downplayed.</p>\n\n<p>While Kletz’s book pertains to chemical engineering, I see several universal truths that apply to any situation and industry. For example, another quote, “What\nyou don’t have, can’t leak” is remarkably similar to the idea that code you don’t have is <em>maintainless</em> and won’t have bugs. There are likely analogous\nprinciples in our field.</p>\n\n<p>However, even at this stage, the process of knowledge acquisition can be accelerated. There are several ways to do it, such as creating procedures, diagrams,\ncharts, and documentation.</p>\n\n<p>Documentation is like treasure maps in the business world. Creating documentation is one thing, but keeping it up-to-date within an organization (regardless of\nits size) is a challenge. Encouraging the team to regularly update documentation is also a challenge. Even the best-prepared documentation often lacks many\ndetails, like the rationale behind specific business decisions, why a particular database or framework was chosen, or why we use technology <em>Y</em> instead of the\nmore prevalent <em>X</em> throughout the company.</p>\n\n<p>So, while documentation is like treasure maps for your company, recorded, organized, and structured information about processes, systems, and practices within\nthe company are akin to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). ADRs are like the flight recorders of our business. They contain records of critical decisions\nmade during system design or significant technological choices.</p>\n\n<p>Why is this important? When creating new things, we make numerous decisions that may appear irrational without the right context later on. ADRs are like opening\na box that explains why these decisions were made. It’s the key to understanding the company’s history and evolution. In the context of our <em>BDS</em>, ADRs are\nlike recordings of experts’ thoughts when making key decisions. When these experts leave, these recordings become a treasure trove of knowledge, helping us\navoid repeating the same mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>A common scenario emerges: the team tasked with addressing the problem must invest valuable time in rediscovering solutions, experimenting with potential fixes,\nor even resorting to trial and error. This not only prolongs the problem-solving process but can also result in suboptimal resolutions, increased frustration,\nand a negative impact on overall productivity. Thanks to documentation and ADR we can significantly reduce this time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"an-alternative-to-lengthy-documentation\">An alternative to lengthy documentation?</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No one reads.\nIf someone does read, he doesn’t understand.\nIf he understands, he immediately forgets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, just as is the case in the above quote from Stanisław Lem <sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>, the problem with documentation, procedures, and ADRs is that people need to\nfamiliarize themselves with them. I suppose that even at SpaceX, it’s doubtful this would be considered the most thrilling reading material, or maybe I am just\nmistaken. Anyway, even if someone manages to get through the documentation, they’ll only retain what they understand. We’re presented with the work of others,\nwith their imposed ways of thinking and decision-making. Often, questions arise to which no one knows the answers, and the people who do know are no longer with\nthe company.</p>\n\n<p>Since we now know our mental limitations, instead of forcing people to sift through stacks of documentation, we can\nuse <a href=\"https://blog.allegro.tech/2022/07/event-storming-workshops.html\">EventStorming</a>. This technique helps understand business processes, identify events and\nactivities, and integrate knowledge in an understandable way. We focus on behaviors, on what changes and why. Together, we develop a solution and understand the\nprocesses because we see them from start to finish. Understanding a process through EventStorming is faster and easier than reading documentation. During an\nEventStorming session, most questions find answers, and knowledge can be conveyed to many people simultaneously, whether they are technical or not. The most\nsignificant artifact of such sessions is that you can discuss why the process looks the way it does, why a specific sequence was chosen, and not another —\nessentially, a mega-mix of documentation, ADR, and conversation. I emphasize once more that this understanding of the process is developed collectively —\neveryone feels as a part of the solution. In the case of our <em>BDS</em>, EventStorming is like capturing the thoughts of experts when making crucial decisions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"real-life-example\">Real life example</h3>\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://allegro.tech/\">Allegro</a>, we recently had a situation where the entire development team responsible for a critical service was moved to a different\nproject. The new team, which inherited the service, had the opportunity to collaborate with the departing team for a period. However, in this context, we also\nconducted EventStorming sessions. To provide more detail, these sessions extended over two full days, each lasting 8 hours. The knowledge accumulated over the\npast five years was not merely confined to two plotter paper-sized sheets, each stretching 6 meters in length, but was primarily assimilated within the\nparticipants’ minds in a seamless manner. I believe this facilitated the new team in gaining greater confidence when taking over the domain.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, you don’t need to spend a lot of time on EventStorming to uncover enough business knowledge. In the case mentioned earlier, the session lasted\ntwo days, but it involved an entire team. For an individual, a two-hour workshop can be enough to see the big picture of our process. Although EventStorming\nallows us to absorb a dose of knowledge relatively easily to know <em>what and why</em> is changing in our process, the devil is in the detail. To really understand\n<em>how</em> this process is changing, it’s best to start by doing small tasks under the guidance of an experienced person.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"seeking-uml-like-alternatives\">Seeking UML-like Alternatives?</h2>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, EventStorming is not the answer to all knowledge loss-related problems. While I don’t question how fantastic this tool is, the knowledge acquired\nthrough it will remain only in the participants’ minds. If it’s not somehow preserved in the form of documentation or ADRs, it may turn out to be just as\nfleeting as departing employees. What can be done about this? Our initial thoughts may lead us to create some form of description or documentation, which, as we\nknow, comes with the challenge of its preparation and the cognitive overload for someone trying to assimilate new knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that when dealing with the issue of knowledge loss and its effective transfer, it’s worth mentioning tools like BPMN, which stands for Business Process\nModel and Notation. BPMN provides a standardized graphical representation of business processes. By using BPMN diagrams, we can visually map\nworkflows and procedures. Such an approach not only simplifies the understanding of complex processes but also aids in comprehensive documentation. When\ncombined with other knowledge-sharing techniques, such as EventStorming, BPMN can be a powerful asset in preserving and transferring critical business\nknowledge.</p>\n\n<p>However, BPMN has an elaborate set of symbols and notation rules, which can make creating and interpreting diagrams complicated for some individuals. Creating\nadvanced BPMN diagrams and fully utilizing the notation’s potential requires specialized knowledge and experience. People unfamiliar with BPMN may struggle\nto use it effectively. Despite these inconveniences, BPMN still remains a valuable tool for modeling and documenting business processes in many organizations. I\nbelieve it complements the previously mentioned techniques perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>Just remember to have the right tools in your arsenal and, more importantly, to choose the appropriate tool for the situation, considering both its strengths\nand weaknesses.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"one-more-thing\">One more thing…</h2>\n\n<p><em>Time to Problem Resolution</em> metric serves as a clear indicator of an organization’s efficiency in addressing challenges.

We have hundreds of MongoDB databases running on our on—premise servers.\nIn 2022 we decided that we need to migrate all our MongoDB databases\nfrom existing shared clusters to new MongoDB clusters hosted on Kubernetes pods with separated resources.\nTo perform the migration of all databases we needed a tool for transfering all the data and keeping consistency between old and new databases.\nThat’s how <em>mongo-migration-stream</em> project was born.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-do-we-needed-to-migrate-mongodb-databases-at-all\">Why do we needed to migrate MongoDB databases at all?</h2>\n\n<p>At Allegro we are managing tens of MongoDB clusters, with hundreds of MongoDB databases running on them.\nThis kind of approach, where one MongoDB cluster runs multiple MongoDB databases, allowed us to utilize resources\nmore effectively, while at the same time easing maintenance of clusters.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-09-14-online-mongodb-migration/one_cluster_multiple_databases.png\" alt=\"Old approach\" /></p>\n\n<p>We’ve been living with this approach for years, but over time, more and more databases were\ncreated on shared clusters, increasing the frequency of the noisy neighbour problem.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"noisy-neighbour-problem\">Noisy neighbour problem</h3>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, a noisy neighbour situation appears while multiple applications run on shared infrastructure,\nand one of those applications starts to consume so many resources (like CPU, RAM or Storage),\nthat it causes starvation of other applications.</p>\n\n<p>At Allegro this problem started to be visible because over the years we’ve created more and more new MongoDB databases\nwhich were hosted on a fixed number of clusters.</p>\n\n<p>The most common cause of the noisy neighbour problem in the Allegro infrastructure was long time high CPU usage caused by one of MongoDB databases on a given cluster.\nOn various occasions it occurred that a non-optimal query performed on a large collection was consuming too much CPU,\nnegatively affecting all the other databases on that cluster, making them slower or completely unresponsive.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-09-14-online-mongodb-migration/cluster_cpu.png\" alt=\"Cluster CPU usage\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mongodb-on-kubernetes-as-a-solution-to-the-noisy-neighbour-problem\">MongoDB on Kubernetes as a solution to the noisy neighbour problem</h3>\n\n<p>To solve the noisy neighbour problem a separate team implemented a solution allowing Allegro engineers to create independent MongoDB clusters on Kubernetes.\nFrom now on, each MongoDB cluster is formed of multiple replicas and an arbiter spread among datacenters, serving only a single MongoDB database.\nRunning each database on a separate cluster with isolated resources managed by Kubernetes was our solution to the noisy neighbour problem.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-09-14-online-mongodb-migration/k8s_cpu.png\" alt=\"Kubernetes CPU usage\" /></p>\n\n<p>At this point we knew what we needed to do to solve our problems — we had to migrate all MongoDB databases from old shared clusters\nto new independent clusters on Kubernetes. Now came the time to answer the question: <em>How should we do it?</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"available-options\">Available options</h2>\n\n<p>Firstly, we prepared a list of requirements which a tool for migrating databases (referred to as <em>migrator</em>) had to meet in order to perform\nsuccessful migrations.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"requirements\">Requirements</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Migrator must be able to migrate databases from older MongoDB versions to newer ones,</li>\n  <li>Migrator must be able to migrate <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">ReplicaSets</code> and sharded clusters,</li>\n  <li>Migrator must copy indexes from source database to destination database,</li>\n  <li>Migrator must be able to handle more than 10k write operations per second,</li>\n  <li>Migration must be performed without any downtime,</li>\n  <li>Migration cannot affect database clients,</li>\n  <li>Database owners (software engineers) need to be able to perform migrations on their own.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"existing-solutions\">Existing solutions</h3>\n\n<p>Having defined a list of requirements, we checked what tools were available on the market at the time.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"py-mongo-sync\"><a href=\"https://github.com/caosiyang/py-mongo-sync\">py-mongo-sync</a></h4>\n\n<p>According to documentation <em>py-mongo-sync</em> is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Oplog—based data sync tool that synchronizes data from a replica set to another deployment,\ne.g.: standalone, replica set, and sharded cluster.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you can see, <em>py-mongo-sync</em> is not a tool that would suit our needs from end to end.\n<em>py-mongo-sync</em> focuses on the synchronization of the data stored on the <em>source database</em> after starting the tool.\nIt doesn’t copy already existing data from the <em>source</em> to the <em>destination database</em>.\nWhat’s more, at the time <em>py-mongo-sync</em> supported MongoDB versions between 2.4 to 3.4, which were older than those used at Allegro.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"mongodb-cluster-to-cluster-sync\"><a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/\">MongoDB Cluster-to-Cluster Sync</a></h4>\n\n<p>On July 22, 2022 MongoDB released <em>mongosync</em> v1.0 — a tool for migrating and synchronizing data between MongoDB clusters.\nAs described in the <em>mongosync</em> documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The mongosync binary is the primary process used in Cluster—to—Cluster Sync. mongosync migrates data from one cluster\nto another and can keep the clusters in continuous sync.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This description sounded like a perfect fit for us! Unfortunately, after initial excitement\n(and hours spent on reading <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/cluster-to-cluster-sync/current/reference/mongosync/\"><em>mongosync</em> documentation</a>)\nwe realized we couldn’t use <em>mongosync</em> as it was able to perform migration and synchronization process only if source database and destination database\nwere both in the exact same version.\nIt meant that there was no option to migrate databases from older MongoDB versions to the newest one, which was a no-go for us.</p>\n\n<p>When we realised that there wasn’t a tool which met all our requirements, we made a tough decision to implement our own online MongoDB migration tool\nnamed <em>mongo-migration-stream</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mongo-migration-stream\">mongo-migration-stream</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/allegro/mongo-migration-stream\"><em>mongo-migration-stream</em></a> is an open source tool from Allegro, that performs online migrations of MongoDB databases.\nIt’s a <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/\">Kotlin</a> application utilising\n<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongodump</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongorestore</code> <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/\">MongoDB Command Line Database Tools</a>\nalong with <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changeStreams/\">Mongo Change Streams</a> mechanism.\nIn this section I will explain how <em>mongo-migration-stream</em> works under the hood, by covering its functionalities from a high—level overview and\nproviding details about its low—level implementation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"mongo-migration-stream-terminology\">mongo-migration-stream terminology</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Source database</em> - MongoDB database which is a data source for migration,</li>\n  <li><em>Destination database</em> - MongoDB database which is a target for the data from <em>source database</em>,</li>\n  <li><em>Transfer</em> - a process of dumping data from <em>source database</em>, and restoring it on <em>destination database</em>,</li>\n  <li><em>Synchronization</em> - a process of keeping eventual consistency between <em>source database</em> and <em>destination database</em>,</li>\n  <li><em>Migration</em> - an end-to-end migration process combining both <em>transfer</em> and <em>synchronization</em> processes,</li>\n  <li><em>Migrator</em> - a tool for performing <em>migrations</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"building-blocks\">Building blocks</h3>\n\n<p>As I’ve mentioned at the beginning of this section, <em>mongo-migration-stream</em> utilises <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongodump</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongorestore</code>, Mongo Change Streams\nand a custom Kotlin application to perform migrations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongodump</code> is used to dump <em>source database</em> in form of a binary file,</li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongorestore</code> is used to restore previously created dump on <em>destination database</em>,</li>\n  <li>Mongo Change Streams are used to keep eventual consistency between <em>source database</em> and <em>destination database</em>,</li>\n  <li>Kotlin application orchestrates, manages, and monitors all above processes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongodump</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongorestore</code> are responsible for the <em>transfer</em> part of migration,\nwhile Mongo Change Streams play the main role in the <em>synchronization</em> process.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"birds-eye-view\">Bird’s eye view</h3>\n\n<p>To implement a <em>migrator</em>, we needed a robust procedure for <em>migrations</em> which ensures that no data is lost during a <em>migration</em>.\nWe have formulated a procedure consisting of six consecutive steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Start listening for Mongo Change Events on <em>source database</em> and save them in the queue,</li>\n  <li>Dump all the data from <em>source database</em> using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongodump</code>,</li>\n  <li>Restore all the data on <em>destination database</em> using <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongorestore</code>,</li>\n  <li>Copy indexes definitions from <em>source database</em> and start creating them on <em>destination database</em>,</li>\n  <li>Start to push all the events stored in the queue (changes on <em>source database</em>) to the <em>destination database</em>,</li>\n  <li>Wait for the queue to empty to establish eventual consistency.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-09-14-online-mongodb-migration/migration_process.png\" alt=\"Migration process\" /></p>\n\n<p>Our migration procedure works flawlessly because processing Mongo Change Events in a sequence guarantees migration idempotency.\nWithout this characteristic, we would have to change the order of steps 1 and 2 in the procedure, creating a possibility of losing data during migration.</p>\n\n<p>To explain this problem in more detail, let’s assume that the <em>source database</em> deals with a continuous high volume of writes.\nIf we had started the migration by performing dump in the first place and then started to listen for events,\nwe would have lost the events stored on the <em>source database</em> in the meantime.\nHowever, as we start the migration by listening for events on the <em>source database</em>, and then proceeding with the dump,\nwe do not lose any of the events stored on the <em>source database</em> during that time.</p>\n\n<p>The diagram below presents how such a kind of <em>write anomaly</em> could happen if we started dumping data before listening for Mongo Change Events.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-09-14-online-mongodb-migration/avoiding_event_loss.png\" alt=\"Avoiding event loss\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"implementation-details\">Implementation details</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"concurrency\">Concurrency</h4>\n\n<p>From the beginning we wanted to make <em>mongo-migration-stream</em> fast — we knew that it would need to cope with databases having more than 10k writes per second.\nAs a result <em>mongo-migration-stream</em> parallelizes migration of one MongoDB database into independent migrations of collections.\nEach database migration consists of multiple little <em>migrators</em> — one <em>migrator</em> per collection in the database.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>transfer</em> process is performed in parallel for each collection, in separate <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongodump</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongorestore</code> processes.\n<em>Synchronization</em> process was also implemented concurrently — at the beginning of migration, each collection on <em>source database</em> is watched individually\nusing <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/changeStreams/#watch-a-collection--database--or-deployment\">Mongo Change Streams with collection target</a>.\nAll collections have their own separate queues in which Mongo Change Events are stored.\nAt the final phase of migration, each of these queues is processed independently.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-09-14-online-mongodb-migration/concurrent_migrations.png\" alt=\"Concurrent migrations\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"initial-data-transfer\">Initial data transfer</h4>\n\n<p>To perform transfer of the database, we’re executing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongodump</code> and <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mongorestore</code> commands for each collection.\nFor that reason, machines on which <em>mongo-migration-stream</em> is running are required to have MongoDB Command Line Database Tools installed.</p>\n\n<p>Dumping data from collection <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">collectionName</code> in <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">source</code> database can be achieved by running a command:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-shell highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>mongodump <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n <span class=\"nt\">--uri</span> <span

constantly receive changes, which <em>mongo-migration-stream</em> is listening to with Mongo Change Streams.\nEvents from the stream are saved in the queue for sending to the <em>destination

data to disk.</p>\n\n<p>In-memory implementation can be used for databases with low traffic, or for testing purposes,\nor on machines with a sufficient amount of RAM (as events are stored as objects

We have hundreds of MongoDB databases running on our on—premise servers.\nIn 2022 we decided that we need to migrate all our MongoDB databases\nfrom existing shared clusters to new MongoDB clusters hosted on Kubernetes pods with separated resources.\nTo perform the migration of all databases we needed a tool for transfering all the data and keeping consistency between old and new databases.\nThat’s how mongo-migration-stream project was born.\nWhy do we needed to migrate MongoDB databases at all?\nAt Allegro we are managing tens of MongoDB clusters, with hundreds of MongoDB databases running on them.\nThis kind of approach, where one MongoDB cluster runs multiple MongoDB databases, allowed us to utilize resources\nmore effectively, while at the same time easing maintenance of clusters.\n\nWe’ve been living with this approach for years, but over time, more and more databases were\ncreated on shared clusters, increasing the frequency of the noisy neighbour problem.\nNoisy neighbour problem\nGenerally speaking, a noisy neighbour situation appears while multiple applications run on shared infrastructure,\nand one of those applications starts to consume so many resources (like CPU, RAM or Storage),\nthat it causes starvation of other applications.\nAt Allegro this problem started to be visible because over the years we’ve created more and more new MongoDB databases\nwhich were hosted on a fixed number of clusters.\nThe most common cause of the noisy neighbour problem in the Allegro infrastructure was long time high CPU usage caused by one of MongoDB databases on a given cluster.\nOn various occasions it occurred that a non-optimal query performed on a large collection was consuming too much CPU,\nnegatively affecting all the other databases on that cluster, making them slower or completely unresponsive.\n\nMongoDB on Kubernetes as a solution to the noisy neighbour problem\nTo solve the noisy neighbour problem a separate team implemented a solution allowing Allegro engineers to create independent MongoDB clusters on Kubernetes.\nFrom now on, each MongoDB cluster is formed of multiple replicas and an arbiter spread among datacenters, serving only a single MongoDB database.\nRunning each database on a separate cluster with isolated resources managed by Kubernetes was our solution to the noisy neighbour problem.\n\nAt this point we knew what we needed to do to solve our problems — we had to migrate all MongoDB databases from old shared clusters\nto new independent clusters on Kubernetes. Now came the time to answer the question: How should we do it?\nAvailable options\nFirstly, we prepared a list of requirements which a tool for migrating databases (referred to as migrator) had to meet in order to perform\nsuccessful migrations.\nRequirements\nMigrator must be able to migrate databases from older MongoDB versions to newer ones,\nMigrator must be able to migrate ReplicaSets and sharded clusters,\nMigrator must copy indexes from source database to destination database,\nMigrator must be able to handle more than 10k write operations per second,\nMigration must be performed without any downtime,\nMigration cannot affect database clients,\nDatabase owners (software engineers) need to be able to perform migrations on their own.\nExisting solutions\nHaving defined a list of requirements, we checked what tools were available on the market at the time.\npy-mongo-sync\nAccording to documentation py-mongo-sync is:\n“Oplog—based data sync tool that synchronizes data from a replica set to another deployment,\ne.g.: standalone, replica set, and sharded cluster.”\nAs you can see, py-mongo-sync is not a tool that would suit our needs from end to end.\npy-mongo-sync focuses on the synchronization of the data stored on the source database after starting the tool.\nIt doesn’t copy already existing data from the source to the destination database.\nWhat’s more, at the time py-mongo-sync supported MongoDB versions between 2.4 to 3.4, which were older than those used at Allegro.\nMongoDB Cluster-to-Cluster Sync\nOn July 22, 2022 MongoDB released mongosync v1.0 — a tool for migrating and synchronizing data between MongoDB clusters.\nAs described in the mongosync documentation:\n“The mongosync binary is the primary process used in Cluster—to—Cluster Sync. mongosync migrates data from one cluster\nto another and can keep the clusters in continuous sync.”\nThis description sounded like a perfect fit for us! Unfortunately, after initial excitement\n(and hours spent on reading mongosync documentation)\nwe realized we couldn’t use mongosync as it was able to perform migration and synchronization process only if source database and destination database\nwere both in the exact same version.\nIt meant that there was no option to migrate databases from older MongoDB versions to the newest one, which was a no-go for us.\nWhen we realised that there wasn’t a tool which met all our requirements, we made a tough decision to implement our own online MongoDB migration tool\nnamed mongo-migration-stream.\nmongo-migration-stream\nmongo-migration-stream is an open source tool from Allegro, that performs online migrations of MongoDB databases.\nIt’s a Kotlin application utilising\nmongodump and mongorestore MongoDB Command Line Database Tools\nalong with Mongo Change Streams mechanism.\nIn this section I will explain how mongo-migration-stream works under the hood, by covering its functionalities from a high—level overview and\nproviding details about its low—level implementation.\nmongo-migration-stream terminology\nSource database - MongoDB database which is a data source for migration,\nDestination database - MongoDB database which is a target for the data from source database,\nTransfer - a process of dumping data from source database, and restoring it on destination database,\nSynchronization - a process of keeping eventual consistency between source database and destination database,\nMigration - an end-to-end migration process combining both transfer and synchronization processes,\nMigrator - a tool for performing migrations.\nBuilding blocks\nAs I’ve mentioned at the beginning of this section, mongo-migration-stream utilises mongodump, mongorestore, Mongo Change Streams\nand a custom Kotlin application to perform migrations.\nmongodump is used to dump source database in form of a binary file,\nmongorestore is used to restore previously created dump on destination database,\nMongo Change Streams are used to keep eventual consistency between source database and destination database,\nKotlin application orchestrates, manages, and monitors all above processes.\nmongodump and mongorestore are responsible for the transfer part of migration,\nwhile Mongo Change Streams play the main role in the synchronization process.\nBird’s eye view\nTo implement a migrator, we needed a robust procedure for migrations which ensures that no data is lost during a migration.\nWe have formulated a procedure consisting of six consecutive steps:\nStart listening for Mongo Change Events on source database and save them in the queue,\nDump all the data from source database using mongodump,\nRestore all the data on destination database using mongorestore,\nCopy indexes definitions from source database and start creating them on destination database,\nStart to push all the events stored in the queue (changes on source database) to the destination database,\nWait for the queue to empty to establish eventual consistency.\n\nOur migration procedure works flawlessly because processing Mongo Change Events in a sequence guarantees migration idempotency.\nWithout this characteristic, we would have to change the order of steps 1 and 2 in the procedure, creating a possibility of losing data during migration.\nTo explain this problem in more detail, let’s assume that the source database deals with a continuous high volume of writes.\nIf we had started the migration by performing dump in the first place and then started to listen for events,\nwe would have lost the events stored on the source database in the meantime.\nHowever, as we start the migration by listening for events on the source database, and then proceeding with the dump,\nwe do not lose any of the events stored on the source database during that time.\nThe diagram below presents how such a kind of write anomaly could happen if we started dumping data before listening for Mongo Change Events.\n\nImplementation details\nConcurrency\nFrom the beginning we wanted to make mongo-migration-stream fast — we knew that it would need to cope with databases having more than 10k writes per second.\nAs a result mongo-migration-stream parallelizes migration of one MongoDB database into independent migrations of collections.\nEach database migration consists of multiple little migrators — one migrator per collection in the database.\nThe transfer process is performed in parallel for each collection, in separate mongodump and mongorestore processes.\nSynchronization process was also implemented concurrently — at the beginning of migration, each collection on source database is watched individually\nusing Mongo Change Streams with collection target.\nAll collections have their own separate queues in which Mongo Change Events are stored.\nAt the final phase of migration, each of these queues is processed independently.\n\nInitial data transfer\nTo perform transfer of the database, we’re executing mongodump and mongorestore commands for each collection.\nFor that reason, machines on which mongo-migration-stream is running are required to have MongoDB Command Line Database Tools installed.\nDumping data from collection collectionName in source database can be achieved by running a command:\n\nmongodump \\\n --uri \"mongodb://mongo_rs36_1:36301,mongo_rs36_2:36302,mongo_rs36_3:36303/?replicaSet=replicaSet36\" \\\n --db source \\\n --collection collectionName \\\n --out /home/user/mongomigrationstream/dumps \\\n --readPreference secondary\n --username username \\\n --config /home/user/mongomigrationstream/password_config/dump.config \\\n --authenticationDatabase admin\n\n\nStarting a mongodump process from Kotlin code is done with Java’s ProcessBuilder feature.\nProcessBuilder requires us to provide a process program and arguments in the form of a list of Strings.\nWe construct this list using prepareCommand function:\n\noverride fun prepareCommand(): List<String> = listOf(\n    mongoToolsPath + \"mongodump\",\n    \"--uri\", dbProperties.uri,\n    \"--db\", dbCollection.dbName,\n    \"--collection\", dbCollection.collectionName,\n    \"--out\", dumpPath,\n    \"--readPreference\", readPreference\n) + credentialsIfNotNull(dbProperties.authenticationProperties, passwordConfigPath)\n\n\nHaving ProcessBuilder with properly configured list of process program and arguments, we’re ready to start a new process\nusing the start() function.\n\nfun runCommand(command: Command): CommandResult {\n    val processBuilder = ProcessBuilder().command(command.prepareCommand()) // Configure ProcessBuilder with mongodump command in form of List<String>\n    currentProcess = processBuilder.start() // Start a new process\n    // ...\n    val exitCode = currentProcess.waitFor()\n    stopRunningCommand()\n    return CommandResult(exitCode)\n}\n\n\nAn analogous approach is implemented in mongo-migration-stream to execute the mongorestore command.\nEvent queue\nDuring the process of migration source database can constantly receive changes, which mongo-migration-stream is listening to with Mongo Change Streams.\nEvents from the stream are saved in the queue for sending to the destination database at a later time.\nCurrently mongo-migration-stream provides two implementations of the queue,\nwhere one implementation stores the data in RAM, while the other one persists the data to disk.\nIn-memory implementation can be used for databases with low traffic, or for testing purposes,\nor on machines with a sufficient amount of RAM (as events are stored as objects on the JVM heap).\n\n// In-memory queue implementation\ninternal class InMemoryEventQueue<E> : EventQueue<E> {\n    private val queue = ConcurrentLinkedQueue<E>()\n\n    override fun offer(element: E): Boolean = queue.offer(element)\n    override fun poll(): E = queue.poll()\n    override fun peek(): E = queue.peek()\n    override fun size(): Int = queue.size\n    override fun removeAll() {\n        queue.removeAll { true }\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn our production setup we decided to use a persistent event queue, which is implemented on top of BigQueue project.\nAs BigQueue only allows enqueuing and dequeuing byte arrays, we had to implement serialization and deserialization of the data from the events.\n\n// Persistent queue implementation\ninternal class BigQueueEventQueue<E : Serializable>(path: String, queueName: String) : EventQueue<E> {\n    private val queue = BigQueueImpl(path, queueName)\n\n    override fun offer(element: E): Boolean = queue.enqueue(element.toByteArray()).let { true }\n    override fun poll(): E = queue.dequeue().toE()\n    override fun peek(): E = queue.peek().toE()\n    override fun size(): Int = queue.size().toInt()\n    override fun removeAll() {\n        queue.removeAll()\n        queue.gc()\n    }\n\n    private fun E.toByteArray(): ByteArray = SerializationUtils.serialize(this)\n    private fun ByteArray.toE(): E = SerializationUtils.deserialize(this)\n}\n\n\nMigrating indexes\nIn early versions of mongo-migration-stream, to copy indexes from source collection to destination collection, we used\nan index rebuilding feature from mongodump and mongorestore tools.\nThis feature works on the principle that the result of mongodump consists of both documents from the collection and definitions of indexes.\nmongorestore can use those definitions to rebuild indexes on destination collection.\nUnfortunately it occurred that rebuilding indexes on destination collection after transfer phase (before starting synchronization process)\nwith the mongorestore tool lengthened the entire mongorestore process, preventing us from emptying the queue in the meantime.\nIt resulted in a growing queue of events to synchronize, ending up with overall longer migration times and higher resources utilisation.\nWe’ve come to the conclusion, that we must rebuild indexes, while at the same time, keep sending events from the queue to destination collection.\nTo migrate indexes without blocking migration process, we implemented a solution which for each collection,\nfetches all its indexes, and rebuilds them on destination collection.\nLooking from the application perspective, we use getRawSourceIndexes function to fetch a list of Documents\n(representing indexes definitions) from source collection,\nand then recreate them on destination collection using createIndexOnDestinationCollection.\n\nprivate fun getRawSourceIndexes(sourceToDestination: SourceToDestination): List<Document> =\n    sourceDb.getCollection(sourceToDestination.source.collectionName).listIndexes()\n        .toList()\n        .filterNot { it.get(\"key\", Document::class.java) == Document().append(\"_id\", 1) }\n        .map {\n            it.remove(\"ns\")\n            it.remove(\"v\")\n            it[\"background\"] = true\n            it\n        }\n\nprivate fun createIndexOnDestinationCollection(\n    sourceToDestination: SourceToDestination,\n    indexDefinition: Document\n) {\n    destinationDb.runCommand(\n        Document().append(\"createIndexes\", sourceToDestination.destination.collectionName)\n            .append(\"indexes\", listOf(indexDefinition))\n    )\n}\n\n\nOur solution can rebuild indexes in both older and newer versions of MongoDB.\nTo support older MongoDB versions we specify { background: true } option, which does not block all operations on a given database during index creation.\nIn case where destination database is newer than or equal to MongoDB 4.2, the { background: true } option is ignored, and\noptimized index build is used.\nIn both scenarios rebuilding indexes does not block synchronization process, improving overall migration times.\nVerification of migration state\nThrought mongo-migration-stream implementation we kept in mind that migrator user should be aware what’s happening within his/her migration.\nFor that purpose mongo-migration-stream exposes data about migration in multiple different ways:\nLogs — migrator logs all important information, so user can verify what’s going on,\nPeriodical checks — when all migrated collections are in synchronization process, migrator starts a periodical check for each collection, verifying if all the data has been migrated, making

While it may appear surprising at first, it was a well-thought-out decision, and actually I’ve already\nperformed such a maneuver once before.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"background\">Background</h2>\n\n<p>A few years ago I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/\">The Engineer/Manager Pendulum</a>\nby Charity Majors, and the follow-up post <a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2019/01/04/engineering-management-the-pendulum-or-the-ladder/\">Engineering Management: The Pendulum Or The Ladder</a>.\nI found both pieces interesting, and quite in line with my own experiences: in my previous job some time earlier I\nhad been a team leader, but consciously joined <a href=\"https://allegro.tech\">Allegro</a> as a software engineer. After a while, I\nbecame a team leader again, and recently, another few years down the line, I went back to engineering yet again.</p>\n\n<p>Both above-mentioned posts make very good points, so I recommend you read them first. What I want to add on top of\nthem are my personal experiences and some tips on organizing a transition between a management and an individual\ncontributor role. The journey in the other direction (from developer to team leader) has been discussed in depth\nelsewhere, so I won’t delve into that.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why\">Why</h2>\n\n<p>Why would I want to switch between developer and team leader roles? The problem is they are both interesting and have\n<a href=\"/2019/06/allegro-culture-tech-leaders-meeting.html\">their own highlights</a>, but you can’t do both at the\nsame time. When you become a manager, not only do you have less time for technical tasks, but you also pretty much\nlose the ability to focus on these tasks even if you do find a time slot. This is because, like it or not, you end\nup with a <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\">manager’s schedule</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/articles/2023-08-22-management-engineering-acrobatics/flying-trapeze-performers.jpg\" alt=\"Circus performers on the flying trapeze, Public Domain image from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Programma_van_Circus_Krone_in_Rotterdam_drie_Alizes_,_vliegende_trapeze_met_o.a.,_Bestanddeelnr_910-4372.jpg\" class=\"small-image\" /></p>\n\n<p>Over time, your technical skills start deteriorating, and if you miss the right moment, you may find yourself at\na point of no return. Like a circus artist on a flying trapeze, you have to time your actions right to avoid\ndisaster. I think this metaphor fits the situation better than that of the pendulum, which moves in its own rhythm,\nindependent of external influences.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, you need to ask yourself whether you actually want to prevent your technical skills from deteriorating. Some\npeople move on to management, wave goodbye to getting their hands dirty, and are completely fine with that. Some tinker\nwith technology in their spare time. As for me, I like technology and would not only prefer to not lose what I have\nlearned so far, but actually want to learn something new. However, due to a number of other hobbies and already\nspending more time in front of the screen than I would like, doing tech in the afternoons was not a viable option for\nme. Hence, the decision to make technology an important part of my job again.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how\">How</h2>\n\n<p>A crucial factor to take into account when planning such a change is that it will take time. If you take your\nteam seriously, you can’t just disappear overnight. You need to think ahead. Do not ask yourself “have I already\nlost my tech skills beyond repair?”. Ask yourself “how will my tech skills be a year from now?”.</p>\n\n<p>Also, keep a cool head. Just as when moving in the opposite direction, from engineer to manager, consider all\nconsequences, both positive and negative. It has been repeated many times that becoming a manager is not a promotion\n(being a lateral move to another career path), but in practice sometimes it is. In particular, it may come with a\nhigher level or salary. Make sure you check all details of your target role in order to avoid unpleasant surprises when\ngoing back. In my case, I was aiming for the Principal Software Engineer role, which is the same level as the Team\nLeader role at Allegro, so there were no issues in this regard.</p>\n\n<p>When I started thinking about making the switch, once I had a rough idea of what I wanted, I talked to my superior.\nThis was an important step: it allowed him to plan ahead, and also to look for opportunities for making the\nreorganization easier. Some elements of the process would depend only on our actions, but some, such as finding a good\nreplacement team leader, would also depend on a number of factors outside our control. Knowing that my boss understood\nmy need, and supported it, mattered a lot, and made the wait and preparations easier.</p>\n\n<p>Chance favors the prepared mind, as Louis Pasteur supposedly said. There happened to be a team leader in\nanother part of the company who was thinking about moving on to a different area. Thanks to being aware of my plan,\nmy boss was able to grab the chance, and we had a perfect match. We discussed with the potential new leader the team\nand the project, and he found them interesting. We planned a transition period, as short as possible, but long enough\nfor me to transfer to him a reasonable part of my knowledge about the team and its work.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we had a specific plan, we could tell the team. It was important to let everyone know as soon as possible, but\nnot before we had a specific plan. Without it, this information would only stir uncertainty. Apart\nfrom telling the team as a whole, I also talked to each person individually, in order to resolve any questions or doubts\nand to try to reduce any problems resulting from the transition as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Waiting for the switch date, we kept meeting online with the new leader, transferring knowledge and preparing him for\nworking with the team. There’s actually quite a lot of stuff a leader needs to know: not only how the project\nworks on technical and business levels, but also current plans, who the stakeholders are and how to work with them,\nand each team member’s individual strengths and development plan. The new leader himself also started meeting\npeople he would now work with, both team members and our product’s stakeholders, and attending team meetings such as\nthe daily stand-up. Despite gradually moving on to other tasks after the switch date, I was still available to clarify\nany doubts, and our boss would also help out when necessary, so the new leader knew he would not be left on his own.\nWhile it required quite a bit of work, the switch went smoothly, and we didn’t notice any serious disturbance to the\nteam’s functioning.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-aftermath\">The Aftermath</h2>\n\n<p>It’s been several months since the switch now. Me changing back to a technical role has certainly required extra work,\nfor me, my boss, and the new team leader. Despite our best efforts, it probably put a little extra strain on the team as\nwell. Nonetheless, I think it was a win-win, even more so thanks to us being able to spot and exploit a happy\ncoincidence. I am glad to be closer to technology again, and the new leader also got to try something new, just as he\nwanted.</p>\n\n<p>There is one more subtle advantage to the whole process. When people leave the team, some knowledge inevitably gets\nlost. One of the reasons is <em>tacit knowledge</em>: there are always things you know, but are not aware of knowing. You can\nuse this knowledge when it’s needed, but you will probably not transfer it to others because you are not even aware of\nits existence in the first place. Removing someone from the team in a controlled manner as happened here (and being\nstill able to reach out to them if needed) causes such latent knowledge to be discovered, and once discovered, to be\npropagated. This causes a little disruption short-term, but in the long run it reduces\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo\">knowledge silos</a> and increases the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor\">bus factor</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When I first started thinking about going back to hands-on technical work for the second time, I had some doubts about\nhow much my technical skills had already deteriorated and how difficult it would be to go back. It seems I made it, but\nnot by much. Had I delayed by one more year, I might have really struggled. It’s not a matter of knowledge: theory,\nespecially generic things that do not change that fast with technology, is not lost so quickly. Also, while a team\nleader, I tried to stay in touch with technology by taking part in task refinement, architecture discussions, on-call\nrotation, etc.</p>\n\n<p>However, I really felt, and to some degree still feel, a difference in practical, hands-on work, such as actually\nwriting code. There are many small quirks that you need to be aware of in order to accomplish things quickly that you\ndon’t even notice if you use them every day and know inside-out. Knowing all the little useful tools, the less often\nused features of your IDE, or what to do when something breaks unexpectedly, make a world of a difference, but this\npractical knowledge gets lost when not used and I had to rebuild it almost from scratch. Another thing that I still\nexperience is the difficulty in focusing on a single topic. Working on a manager’s schedule for several years has taken\nits toll, and now that I often have large contiguous blocks of time, I find myself not using them as effectively as I\ncould, because I have become accustomed to always doing multiple things at once and without a chance to stay focused\nanyway. It’s gradually getting better, but I still feel the impact, and this is probably my biggest surprise of the\nwhole process.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"about-the-principal-software-engineer-role\">About the Principal Software Engineer role</h2>\n\n<p>My current role is that of Principal Software Engineer (PSE). It is a relatively new addition to the junior, mid,\nand senior roles we’ve had so far. It has gone through a number of revisions, and is still evolving. Most people in this\nrole come from a Senior Software Engineer background, so my case of getting there after being a Team Leader is a bit\nuntypical. At many companies, roles like this are called Staff Software Engineer or similar. While still an individual\ncontributor role, a PSE differs from a senior in several ways.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, a PSE is expected to spend significant time on topics whose scope is much larger than a single team can\nhandle. Seniors can also do this, but it’s not a requirement for them. Such topics may be area-wide, such as planning a\nmajor change to a single subsystem’s architecture, or have a company-wide scope. Much work on this level consists of\ncoming up with ideas and discussing them while implementation is often left to others. So, while still technical, this\nrole encompasses less coding than that of a senior. Not very surprising given that generally moving up the career ladder\nmeans more coming up with ideas, teaching others, and planning work, while coding less yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, a PSE should be very autonomous. Most PSEs are not members of regular development teams since they move from\ntask to task depending on where they can help most. This means you cooperate with more people from different parts of\nthe company, but you don’t have the few peers you work with every day that most people have. You don’t get a backlog\nof tasks to work on, but have to plan your work yourself. People do come to you, asking for support or doing something\nfor their project, but that’s just one of many inputs.</p>\n\n<p>Thirdly, since there are few PSEs compared to other positions, for each person the role is a little different. On one\nhand this means you can’t fully know what to expect when you start. On the other, you get to shape the role yourself,\nand personally I enjoy this flexibility.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p>I think the idea of swinging back and forth between engineering and management described in\n<a href=\"https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/\">The Engineer/Manager Pendulum</a>,\nis valid, and my own experience backs it up fully. One element which I want to additionally stress, however, is that\nthe switch is more like a flying trapeze than a pendulum: timing is crucial, and missing the right moment can have\nserious consequences. Becoming a Principal Software Engineer was a unique experience, both on a technical\nlevel and as my de facto last task as a team leader. Who knows what the future holds?

While it can be argued that in many situations it is simply\ncheaper to add another instance of the service than to engage a developer who will work tirelessly to diagnose\nand optimize performance problems, the problem will persist and intensify as the business and its requirements grow.</p>\n\n<p>A similar situation arises with databases. We often store huge amounts of data for auditing or historical purposes.\nWhile the cost of maintaining such databases is negligible at a small scale,\nover time it can become a notable burden on our budget.</p>\n\n<p>I wanted to talk about such a case and how we managed to reduce the cost of maintaining a database nearly 30-fold.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>As the amount of data grows, the need for scaling arises. In the case of <strong>Azure</strong> services, scaling also has its <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/purchasing-models?view=azuresql\">limitations</a>.\nIt is not always possible to infinitely increase the available disk space without scaling other resources (CPU, RAM, I/O).\nIn our case, this limit became apparent when we exceeded 1TB of data. Our database was based on the vCore model,\nwhere we used <strong>4 vCores</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this number of vCores limited the available disk space to <strong>1TB</strong>. Due to the increase in the number of users\nand the demand for disk space, we needed more resources. We continued to scale up, adding not only more disk resources\nbut also computational resources (I will mention that at this point we reached a scale of <strong>3TB</strong> of data, which requires\nat least <strong>12 vCores</strong>). At some point, the cost of maintaining the database amounted to several thousand euros.\nThis prompted us to look for solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Comparing the cost of storing substantial amounts of data within <strong>Azure SQL</strong> and <strong>Storage Account</strong>\n(especially blobs in the <strong>archive</strong> tier), we concluded that we could achieve significant cost reduction\nby archiving old/unused data and placing it in a cost-optimized container.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monthly-cost-of-storing-3tb-of-data\">Monthly cost of storing 3TB of data</h3>\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th>Azure SQL 12vCore 3TB</th>\n    <th>Storage Account Archive tier</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>$2,876.18</td>\n    <td>$31.12</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"analysis\">Analysis</h2>\n<p>After some investigation, It turned out that significant part of data could be safely archived,\nwhich would certainly provide\npotential savings and eliminate the problem of an overgrown database. Most of this data was actually historical.</p>\n\n<p>We implemented a solution that allows for much more scalable data archiving\nby asynchronously loading data into the warehouse.\nHowever, data from before the implementation of aforementioned solution were still generating considerable storage costs.</p>\n\n<p>The idea seemed simple both in concept and execution.

While it can be argued that in many situations it is simply\ncheaper to add another instance of the service than to engage a developer who will work tirelessly to diagnose\nand optimize performance problems, the problem will persist and intensify as the business and its requirements grow.\nA similar situation arises with databases. We often store huge amounts of data for auditing or historical purposes.\nWhile the cost of maintaining such databases is negligible at a small scale,\nover time it can become a notable burden on our budget.\nI wanted to talk about such a case and how we managed to reduce the cost of maintaining a database nearly 30-fold.\nThe problem\nAs the amount of data grows, the need for scaling arises. In the case of Azure services, scaling also has its limitations.\nIt is not always possible to infinitely increase the available disk space without scaling other resources (CPU, RAM, I/O).\nIn our case, this limit became apparent when we exceeded 1TB of data. Our database was based on the vCore model,\nwhere we used 4 vCores.\nUnfortunately, this number of vCores limited the available disk space to 1TB. Due to the increase in the number of users\nand the demand for disk space, we needed more resources. We continued to scale up, adding not only more disk resources\nbut also computational resources (I will mention that at this point we reached a scale of 3TB of data, which requires\nat least 12 vCores). At some point, the cost of maintaining the database amounted to several thousand euros.\nThis prompted us to look for solutions.\nComparing the cost of storing substantial amounts of data within Azure SQL and Storage Account\n(especially blobs in the archive tier), we concluded that we could achieve significant cost reduction\nby archiving old/unused data and placing it in a cost-optimized container.\nMonthly cost of storing 3TB of data\nAzure SQL 12vCore 3TB\n    Storage Account Archive tier\n  \n$2,876.18\n    $31.12\n  \nAnalysis\nAfter some investigation, It turned out that significant part of data could be safely archived,\nwhich would certainly provide\npotential savings and eliminate the problem of an overgrown database. Most of this data was actually historical.\nWe implemented a solution that allows for much more scalable data archiving\nby asynchronously loading data into the warehouse.\nHowever, data from before the implementation of aforementioned solution were still generating considerable storage costs.\nThe idea seemed simple both in concept and execution. However, we immediately encountered several problems.\nExporting such massive amounts of data is a time-consuming process and puts a heavy load on the database\ncausing responsiveness issues.\nDealing with a production system, we could not reduce the reliability and availability of services.\nIn addition, the export functionality offered by the Azure portal is limited to databases up to 200GB in size,\nwhich meant that we had to look for another solution.\nAction plan\nConcept\nAs it turned out, there are ways to export even huge databases.
