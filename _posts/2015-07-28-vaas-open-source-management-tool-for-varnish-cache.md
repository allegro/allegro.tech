We are proud to announce that today we released as open source [Varnish as a Service](https://github.com/allegro/vaas) 
(aka VaaS), a [Varnish Cache](https://www.varnish-cache.org/) management tool. VaaS is a web application with a GUI and 
an API that allows you to populate a database with information about microservices and their back-ends. On the basis of 
this data, VaaS generates a [VCL](https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/VCL) and sends it to Varnish servers in a 
matter of seconds, using native Varnish API (no agent is required on the managed Varnish servers). If you require a more 
complex VCL than the default generated by VaaS, you can overwrite sections of the default VCL or create your own 
template intermingling ordinary VCL with mark ups. These mark ups tell VaaS where in the VCL to generate backends and 
directors or where to generate hints telling Varnish how to route traffic. You can wrap backend hinds with complex rules 
to suit your needs.

The tool has been continually developed and successfuly used for over a year at [Allegro](http://allegro.pl) to manage 
multiple farms of Varnish Cache servers. We got to the point where it’s mature and flexible enough to share with the 
community as we believe there may be people out there who could benefit from using it. The key features that set VaaS 
apart from other tools are:

1. Backends and [directors](https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/reference/vmod_directors.generated.html) are 
separate entities recorded in a database. Changes to back-ends and directors do not affect the VCL template.
2. Varnish API is utilized to distribute VCLs synchronously accross the entire caching server farm. No separate agent 
process on each managed server is required, as opposed to [Varnish Administration 
Console](https://www.varnish-software.com/product/varnish-administration-console-0) (a part of Varnish Plus) and other 
Varnish configuration tools).
3. VaaS utilizes the load balancer built into Varnish. Traffic is routed to directors basing on routing rules (e.g.
URL). Each director distributes traffic to multiple identical back-ends using selected algorithm (round robin, random 
etc).
4. VaaS has an API and a GUI available for internal customers.
5. VaaS generates VCLs using a flexible templating system.

### How it works

The graphic below shows how a change entered via VaaS GUI or API gets distributed to Varnish servers. The VCL is sent 
and then applied on all servers simultaneously. The whole process should not take more than 10 secons. Multiple Varnish 
clusters are supported.

### What are the benefits of using VaaS
Since we started using VaaS on a broader scale in Spring 2014, the most repetitive, time consuming, error prone and 
boring tasks related to VCL maintenance became history. If a member of a team responsible for a microservice needs to 
add, remove or modify a back-end, they can do it themselves using VaaS GUI, or automate the task using VaaS API. This is 
especially useful in an [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) environment.
[Allegro](http://allegro.pl) consists of very many microservices. Each microservice utilizes physical servers, cloud
servers or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. The servers are grouped into directors (a collection of 
back-ends). It would be a very difficult task to maintain a varnish VCL consisting of so many back-ends that come and go 
so often (which is especially true for the cloud and Docker back-ends). This is why every team responsible for a 
microservice maintains their own director by themselves. This wouldn’t be possible without VaaS. What is worth noting, 
the VCL template is maintained by a narrow group of Varnish specialists. That way we can be sure that the template is 
well tested and does what it’s intended to do before being launched into production environment. Even though the VCLs 
are edited frequently by many people, human errors affecting the entire Varnish cluster are highly unlikely if not 
impossible.

### Where you can get it
You can download VaaS source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/allegro/vaas).

### What versions of Varnish are supported
VaaS allows you to choose between Varnish 3 and Varnish 4 VCL templates.

### How to use it
VaaS documentation is available in [Read The Docs](https://rtd.allegrogroup.com/docs/vaas/en/latest/). There, you can 
find instructions on how to set VaaS up and how to use it. Since setting up VaaS can be quite a demanding task (you need 
at least one Varnish server, at least one sample back-end, a database server and a VaaS application server), we have 
created a test environment that you can use to easily familiarize yourself with VaaS. We call it [VaaS in 
Vagrant](https://rtd.allegrogroup.com/docs/vaas/en/latest/quick-start/vagrant/).

### We count on your input
We believe VaaS is mature enough to safely use it in production. However, the more people use VaaS, the greater chance 
that bugs will be discovered. Therefore we encourage you to participate in VaaS development on [Git 
Hub](https://github.com/allegro/vaas). Similarly, if you think VaaS would benefit from a feature that we haven’t yet
implemented, feel free to create a pull request. We will be more than happy to review and possibly include it in future 
VaaS releases.
