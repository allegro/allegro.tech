title: Minimum Viable Product – already a cliché or a misunderstood concept?

At the beginning I would like to stress that this is not yet another article about minimum viable product (MVP)
mechanics. For theory and examples of its use in practice, please refer to the great article by [Andrzej Winnicki](http://allegro.tech/2015/01/story-about-delivering-products-part2.html). What made me share my thoughts on MVP is what
I consider a prerequisite to start working with this method. Moreover, I also recognised this prerequisite as the
biggest obstacle that is stopping many enthusiasts from its full understanding. 

In Agile world everybody talks about MVP. We all use it, we all care about maximising time to market and delivering just
the right product to customers, and we are all aware how crucial the concept is in ever-changing market conditions.
Product Owners plan their businesses so that they can monetise them promptly, scrum masters help teams understand the
importance of customer feedback and developers learn how to build a solution using mocks and metrics tools. That would
be the theory. In practice, as an Agile Coach I usually hear from developers and product owners that it is a waste to
build something small and indefinite only to receive feedback, especially if it is known already what we are trying to
build. Well, hard to argue with that. Unless we investigate such claim deeper. “Known already” is a phrase that grabs my
attention. 

For a quick reminder, I like Eric Ries’ definition of MVP: “The minimum viable product is that version of a new product
which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.” What is
more, apart from learning purposes and discovering what the market really needs, MVP is also about delivering value
faster. And as I see it now, the mysterious “value” is what makes MVP so difficult to understand at “Ri” stage
(practitioner’s level, where what you have learned is already natural and done automatically with space to question and
evaluate against own experience and beliefs; [Shu-Ha-Ri](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Shu+Ha+Ri) – concept describing
stages of learning to mastery).

I’ve recently come back from a trip to Thailand, where apart from beautiful sceneries, cuisine and people, I also
encountered beautiful example of MVP. In Bangkok I stayed in a guesthouse that had been newly opened to visitors.  What
it offered were obviously rooms to sleep in but not much in terms of extra facilities. Instead of reception desk there
was a school table in the middle of a foyer (frankly speaking, it was not a foyer per se), instead of a bar there was a
refrigerator in a corner and a coffee machine on a basic table. As I see it, once opened to first customer, decision on
where, how big or how organised reception desk should be, would be made in the future depending on guests needs and
volume. Same with the bar, at this stage, the owner does not know whether people would only sleep at his place and maybe
occasionally buy some refreshments or if they need extensive bar area serving different dishes and variety of drinks. It
is still possible to arrange foyer space according to actual demand, but the key customer need (aka value) is already
being met – visitors have beds to sleep in.

I found this example so great because majority of my debates about MVP described in the first paragraph of this text
ended with an agreement from scrum teams that the concept is indeed desirable but not for common, simple goals with well
known outcome, such as houses, bridges, new billing and vindication system, e-commerce application etc.  Here comes
“well known” expression again. If you stop for a moment and reflect why you are building a new self-managed job portal,
complex data grouping dashboards or brand new chatting tool, which archives everything, you might realise that the
features you plan to offer are not the actual customer needs, or that you grasped the needs right but there are much
more ways to meet them than you first planned. “Well known” outcome is not so well known, it is barely what you have in
mind thinking about one initiative.

Whatever you are currently working on, think first what value you want to deliver to your customers, and only then move
to planning how to deliver this value fast. A bridge may seem to be a well-known outcome of a project. However,
depending on a value you want to deliver, it can take so many different shapes. Let’s say the need is straightforward
and it is built solely to move across the river.  It can still be done in multiple ways based on users (pedestrians
only, vehicles, mixed, heavy machines), based on volume, frequency of traffic, climate etc. What is more, let’s say that
to move across the river you actually do not need a bridge, because you may offer much cheaper or fun or efficient means
of crossing i.e. boat, stilts, catapult, floating rags or zip line. On top of that, now imagine that the need to meet
was not crossing the river, but a prestige of investor, or a desire to build anything on one’s own, or a need to explore
what is on the other side but with no need to physically be there. Now the alternative shapes of the bridge become
almost infinite.  

In order to capture this unique value your customer has in mind starting the project, I find it useful to apply coaching
techniques. [Dilts' Neurological Levels Model](http://www.skillsyouneed.com/lead/logical-levels.html), [Cartesian Questions](http://communicatingexcellence.com/cartesian-questions/), change of perspectives, all of these techniques may
serve to search inner motivation, to validate what and why you want to achieve. Such approach is essential to understand
your customers’ needs, what is a hidden value one wants to obtain. Based on this value, you can now search for numerous
approaches you can pursuit to deliver it. Once you find them, only then start applying techniques that help in
innovative and dynamic environment by verifying hypotheses, e.g. minimum viable product. Minimum is this tacit value and
the next crucial step is to plan your work so that you deliver end-2-end process soon. Small and prompt delivery enables
you to verify whether you grasped this need correctly and to adapt your plans accordingly.

To sum up, it may feel like constant verification of what is needed, how it was understood and what is real vs. assumed.
Indeed, I believe that assumptions are detrimental to any business and we should not only listen to our customers but
also understand them. Searching for an apprehension of customer value and what kind of needs we are trying to address is
a step closer to success.

curious to get to know your experience and reflections.
